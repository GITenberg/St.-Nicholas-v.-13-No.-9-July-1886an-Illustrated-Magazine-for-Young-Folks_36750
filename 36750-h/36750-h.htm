<h2>LA FAYETTE.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Mrs. Eugenia M. Hodge.</span></h3>

<p>One hundred and nine years ago, in the month of February, 1777, a young French guardsman ran away to sea.</p>

<p>And a most singular running away it was. He did not wish to be a sailor, but he was so anxious to go that he bought a
ship to run away in,&mdash;for he was a very wealthy young man; and though he was only nineteen, he held a commission as
major-general in the armies of a land three thousand miles away&mdash;a land he had never seen and the language of which
he could not speak. The King of France commanded him to remain at home; his friends and relatives tried to restrain him;
and even the representatives, or agents, of the country in defense of which he desired to fight would not encourage his
purpose. And when the young man, while dining at the house of the British Ambassador to France, openly avowed his
sympathy with a downtrodden people, and his determination to help them gain their freedom, the Ambassador acted quickly.
At his request, the rash young enthusiast was arrested by the French Government, and orders were given to seize his
ship, which was awaiting him at Bordeaux. But ship and owner both slipped away, and sailing from the port of Pasajes in
Spain, the runaway, with eleven chosen companions, was soon on the sea, bound for America, and beyond the reach of both
friends and foes.</p>

<p>On April 25, 1777, he landed at the little port of Georgetown, at the mouth of the Great Pee Dee river in South
Carolina; and from that day forward the career of Marie Jean Paul Roch Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de La Fayette, has
held a place in the history of America, and in the interest and affection of the American people.</p>

<p>When he first arrived in the land for which he desired to fight, however, he found but a cool reception. The Congress
of the United States was poor, and so many good and brave American officers who had proved their worth were desirous of
commissions as major-generals, that the commission promised to this young Frenchman could not easily be put in force so
far as an actual command and a salary were concerned.</p>

<p>But the young general had come across the sea for a purpose, and money and position were not parts of that purpose.
He expressed his desire to serve in the American army upon two very singular conditions, namely: that he should receive
no pay, and that he should act as a volunteer. The Congress was so impressed with the enthusiasm and self-sacrifice of
the young Frenchman that, on July 31, 1777, it passed a resolution directing that "his services be accepted and that, in
consideration of his zeal, illustrious family and connections, he have the rank and commission of a Major-General of the
United States."</p>

<p>General Washington was greatly attracted by the energy and earnestness of the young nobleman. He took him into what
was called his "military family," assigned him to special and honorable duty; and when the young volunteer was wounded
at the battle of Brandywine, the Commander-in-Chief praised his "bravery and military ardor" so highly that the Congress
gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">[Pg 644]</a></span>
La Fayette the command of a division. Thus, before he was twenty, he was actually a general, and already, as one
historian says, he had "justified the boyish rashness which his friends deplored and his sovereign resented, and had
acquired a place in history."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding General Washington's assertion to Congress that La Fayette had made "great proficiency in our
language," the young marquis's pronunciation of English was far from perfect. French, Spanish, and Italian were all
familiar to him, but his English was not readily understood by the men he was called upon to command. It was therefore
necessary to find as his aid-de-camp one who could quickly interpret the orders of his commanding officer.</p>

</div>

<p>Such an aid was at last found in the person of a certain young Connecticut adjutant on the regimental staff of
dashing Brigadier-General Wayne,&mdash;"Mad Anthony" Wayne, the hero of Stony Point.</p>

<p>This young adjutant was of almost the same age as Lafayette; he had received, what was rare enough in those old days,
an excellent college education, and he was said to be the only man in the American army who could speak French and
English equally well.</p>

<p>These young men, General La Fayette and his aid, grew very fond of each other during an intimate acquaintance of
nearly seven years. The French marquis, with that overflow of spirits and outward demonstration so noticeable in most
Frenchmen, freely showed his affection for the more reserved American&mdash;often throwing his arms around his neck,
kissing him upon the cheek and calling him "My brave, my good, my virtuous, my adopted brother!"</p>

<p>After the battle of Monmouth, which occurred on June 28, 1778, and in which La Fayette's command was engaged against
the British forces, who were routed, the marquis was enthusiastic in praise of the gallant conduct of his friend and
aid. Not content with this, he sent to him some years after, when the aid-de-camp, then a colonel in rank, was elected
to political honors, the following acrostic, as a souvenir, expressive of the esteem and remembrance of his former
commander. The initial letters of each line of the poem will spell out for you the name of this soldier friend of La
Fayette. And here is an exact copy of the acrostic and of the postscript that accompanied it:</p>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<span class="ind1">Sage of the East! where wisdom rears her head,<br /></span>
		<span class="ind1">Augustus, taught in virtue's path to tread,<br /></span>

	</div>
	<div class="stanza">

	</div>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">M. D. La Fayette.</span></p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">
	<p>P. S.&mdash;The Colonel will readily apologize for the inaccuracies of an unskillful muse, and be convinced the high
estimation of his amiable character could alone actuate the author of the foregoing.</p>
	<p class="right"><span class="smcap">M. D. La Fayette.</span></p>
</div>

<p>So the name of the young general's friend and aid-de-camp was Samuel Augustus Barker.</p>

<hr style="width:10%" />

<p>Years passed. The Revolution was over. America was free. The French Revolution, with all its horrors and successes,
had made France a republic. Napoleon had risen, conquered, ruled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">[Pg 645]</a></span>
fallen, and died, and the first quarter of the nineteenth century was nearly completed, when, in August, 1824, an old
French gentleman who had been an active participant in several of these historic scenes arrived in New York. It was
General the Marquis de La Fayette, now a veteran of nearly seventy, returning to America as the honored guest of the
growing and prosperous republic he had helped to found.</p>

<p>His journey through the land was like a triumph. Flowers and decorations brightened his path, cheering people and
booming cannon welcomed his approach. And in one of those welcomings, in a little village in Central New York, a cannon,
which was heavily loaded for a salute in honor of the nation's guest, exploded, and killed a plucky young fellow who had
volunteered to "touch off" the over-charged gun when no one else dared. Some months after, the old marquis chanced to
hear of the tragedy, and at once his sympathies were aroused for the widowed mother of the young man.</p>

<p>He at once wrote to the son of the man who had been his comrade in arms in the revolutionary days half a century
before, asking full information concerning the fatal accident, and the needs of the mother of the poor young man who was
killed; and having thus learned all the facts, sent the sum of one thousand dollars to relieve the mother's necessities
and to pay off the mortgage on her little home.</p>

<p>I have before me, as I write, the original letter written by the General to the son of his old friend, the paper
marked and yellow with the creases of sixty years; and as I read it again, I feel that of all the incidents of the
singularly eventful life of La Fayette there are none that show his noble nature more fully than those I have noted
here: his enthusiastic services in behalf of an oppressed people, his close and devoted affection for his friend and
comrade, and the impulsive generosity of a heart that was at once manly, tender, and true.</p>

<p>And as I write, I am grateful that I can claim a certain association with that honored name of La Fayette; for the
young adjutant to whom the acrostic was addressed and the friend through whom the gift to the widow was communicated
were respectively my grandfather and my father.</p>

<p>It is at least pleasant to know that one's ancestors were the intimate friends of so noble a man, of whom one
biographer has recently said: "He was brave even to rashness, his life was one of constant peril, and yet he never
shrank from any danger or responsibility if he saw the way open to spare life or suffering, to protect the defenseless,
to sustain law and preserve order."</p>

<p>At the southern extremity of Union Square, in the city of New York, there is a bronze statue of La Fayette. As you
have already been told in <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span>, it represents him in graceful pose and with earnest
face and gesture, "making offer of his sword to the country he admired&mdash;the country that sorely needed his aid. The
left hand is extended as if in greeting and friendly self-surrender, and the right hand, which holds the sword, is
pressed against the breast, as if implying that his whole heart goes with his sword." Lafayette's words, "As soon as I
heard of American independence, my heart was enlisted," are inscribed upon the pedestal of the statue; and a short
distance from it, in the plaza adjoining the square, is an equestrian statue of Washington. It is fitting that the
bronze images of those two great men should thus be placed together, as the names of Washington and La Fayette are
forever coupled in the history and in the affections of the American people.</p>

<h2>LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Frances Hodgson Burnett.</span></h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter X.</span></h4>


<div class="imgleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus652.jpg" width="100" height="115" alt="T" title="" /></div>

<p>he truth was that Mrs. Errol had found a great many sad things in the course of her work among the poor of the little
village that appeared so picturesque when it was seen from the moor-sides. Everything was not as picturesque, when seen
near by, as it looked from a distance. She had found idleness and poverty and ignorance where there should have been
comfort and industry. And she had discovered, after a while, that Erleboro was considered to be the worst village in
that part of the country. Mr. Mordaunt had told her a great many of his difficulties and discouragements, and she had
found out a great deal by herself. The agents who had managed the property had always been chosen to please the Earl,
and had cared nothing for the degradation and wretchedness of the poor tenants. Many things, therefore, had been
neglected which should have been attended to, and matters had gone from bad to worse.</p>

<p>As to Earl's Court, it was a disgrace, with its dilapidated houses and miserable, careless, sickly people. When first
Mrs. Errol went to the place, it made her shudder. Such ugliness and slovenliness and want seemed worse in a country
place than in a city. It seemed as if there it might be helped. And as she looked at the squalid, uncared-for children
growing up in the midst of vice and brutal indifference, she thought of her own little boy spending his days in the
great, splendid castle, guarded and served like a young prince, having no wish ungratified, and knowing nothing but
luxury and ease and beauty. And a bold thought came into her wise little mother-heart. Gradually she had begun to see,
as had others, that it had been her boy's good fortune to please the Earl very much, and that he would scarcely be
likely to be denied anything for which he expressed a desire.</p>

<p>"The Earl would give him anything," she said to Mr. Mordaunt. "He would indulge his every whim. Why should not that
indulgence be used for the good of others? It is for me to see that this shall come to pass."</p>

<p>She knew she could trust the kind, childish heart; so she told the little fellow the story of Earl's Court, feeling
sure that he would speak of it to his grandfather, and hoping that some good results would follow.</p>

<p>And strange as it appeared to every one, good results did follow. The fact was that the strongest power to influence
the Earl was his grandson's perfect confidence in him&mdash;the fact that Cedric always believed that his grandfather
was going to do what was right and generous. He could not quite make up his mind to let him discover that he had no
inclination to be generous at all, and that he wanted his own way on all occasions, whether it was right or wrong. It
was such a novelty to be regarded with admiration as a benefactor of the entire human race, and the soul of nobility,
that he did not enjoy the idea of looking into the affectionate brown eyes, and saying: "I am a violent, selfish old
rascal; I never did a generous thing in my life, and I don't care about Earl's Court or the poor people"&mdash;or
something which would amount to the same thing. He actually had learned to be fond enough of that small boy with the mop
of yellow love-locks, to feel that he himself would prefer to be guilty of an amiable action now and then. And
so&mdash;though he laughed at himself&mdash;after some reflection, he sent for Newick, and had quite a long interview
with him on the subject of the Court, and it was decided that the wretched hovels should be pulled down and new houses
should be built.</p>

<p>"It is Lord Fauntleroy who insists on it," he said dryly; "he thinks it will improve the property. You can tell the
tenants that it's his idea." And he looked down at his small lordship, who was lying on the hearth-rug playing with
Dougal. The great dog was the lad's constant companion, and followed him about everywhere, stalking solemnly after him
when he walked, and trotting majestically behind when he rode or drove.</p>

<p>Of course, both the country people and the town people heard of the proposed improvement. At first, many of them
would not believe it; but when a small army of workmen arrived and commenced pulling down the crazy, squalid cottages,
people began to understand that little Lord Fauntleroy had done them a good turn again, and that through his innocent
interference the scandal of Earl's Court had at last been removed. If he had only known how they talked about him and
praised him everywhere, and prophesied great things for him when he grew up, how astonished he would have been! But he
never suspected it. He lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">[Pg 647]</a></span>
his simple, happy child life,&mdash;frolicking about in the park; chasing the rabbits to their burrows; lying under the
trees on the grass, or on the rug in the library, reading wonderful books and talking to the Earl about them, and then
telling the stories again to his mother; writing long letters to Dick and Mr. Hobbs, who responded in characteristic
fashion; riding out at his grandfather's side, or with Wilkins as escort. As they rode through the market town, he used
to see the people turn and look, and he noticed that as they lifted their hats their faces often brightened very much,
but he thought it was all because his grandfather was with him.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/illus654.jpg" width="447" height="600" alt="The Workmen Liked to See Him Stand Among Them, Talking Away, With His Hands in His Pockets" title="" />
<span class="caption">"THE WORKMEN LIKED TO SEE HIM STAND AMONG THEM, TALKING AWAY, WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS."</span>
</div>

<p>"They are so fond of you," he once said, looking up at his lordship with a bright smile. "Do you see how glad they
are when they see you? I hope they will some day be as fond of me. It must be nice to have <em>every</em>body like you."
And he felt quite proud to be the grandson of so greatly admired and beloved an individual.</p>

<p>When the cottages were being built, the lad and his grandfather used to ride over to Earl's Court together to look at
them, and Fauntleroy was full of interest. He would dismount from his pony and go and make acquaintance with the
workman, asking them questions about building and bricklaying, and telling them things about America. After two or three
such conversations, he was able to enlighten the Earl on the subject of brickmaking, as they rode home.</p>

<p>"I always like to know about things like those," he said, "because you never know what you are coming to."</p>

<p>When he left them, the workmen used to talk him over among themselves, and laugh at his odd, innocent speeches; but
they liked him, and liked to see him stand among them, talking away, with his hands in his pockets, his hat pushed back
on his curls, and his small face full of eagerness. "He's a rare un," they used to say. "An' a woise little outspoken
chap too. Not much o' th' bad stock in him." And they would go home and tell their wives about him, and the women would
tell each other, and so it came about that almost every one talked of, or knew some story of, little Lord Fauntleroy;
and gradually almost every one knew that the "wicked Earl" had found something he cared for at last&mdash;something
which had touched and even warmed his hard, bitter old heart.</p>

<p>But no one knew quite how much it had been warmed, and how day by day the old man found himself caring more and more
for the child, who was the only creature that had ever trusted him. He found himself looking forward to the time when
Cedric would be a young man, strong and beautiful, with life all before him, but having still that kind heart and the
power to make friends everywhere; and the Earl wondered what the lad would do, and how he would use his gifts. Often as
he watched the little fellow lying upon the hearth, conning some big book, the light shining on the bright young head,
his old eyes would gleam and his cheek would flush.</p>

<p>"The boy can do anything," he would say to himself, "anything!"</p>

<p>He never spoke to any one else of his feeling for Cedric; when he spoke of him to others it was always with the same
grim smile. But Fauntleroy soon knew that his grandfather loved him and always liked him to be near&mdash;near to his
chair if they were in the library, opposite to him at table, or by his side when he rode or drove or took his evening
walk on the broad terrace.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," Cedric said once, looking up from his book as he lay on the rug, "do you remember what I said to
you that first night about our being good companions? I don't think any people could be better companions than we are,
do you?"</p>

<p>"We are pretty good companions, I should say," replied his lordship. "Come here."</p>

<p>Fauntleroy scrambled up and went to him.</p>

<p>"Is there anything you want," the Earl asked; "anything you have not?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">[Pg 648]</a></span></p>

<p>The little fellow's brown eyes fixed themselves on his grandfather with a rather wistful look.</p>

<p>"Only one thing," he answered.</p>

<p>"What is that?" inquired the Earl.</p>

<p>Fauntleroy was silent a second. He had not thought matters over to himself so long for nothing.</p>

<p>"What is it?" my lord repeated.</p>

<p>Fauntleroy answered.</p>

<p>"It is Dearest," he said.</p>

<p>The old Earl winced a little.</p>

<p>"But you see her almost everyday," he said. "Is not that enough?"</p>

<p>"I used to see her all the time," said Fauntleroy. "She used to kiss me when I went to sleep at night, and in the
morning she was always there, and we could tell each other things without waiting."</p>

<p>The old eyes and the young ones looked into each other through a moment of silence. Then the Earl knitted his
brows.</p>

<p>"Do you <em>never</em> forget about your mother?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," answered Fauntleroy, "never; and she never forgets about me. I shouldn't forget about <em>you</em>, you know,
if I didn't live with you. I should think about you all the more."</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said the Earl, after looking at him a moment longer, "I believe you would!"</p>

<p>The jealous pang that came when the boy spoke so of his mother seemed even stronger than it had been before&mdash;it
was stronger because of this old man's increasing affection for the boy.</p>

<p>But it was not long before he had other pangs, so much harder to face that he almost forgot, for the time, he had
ever hated his son's wife at all. And in a strange and startling way it happened. One evening, just before the Earl's
Court cottages were completed, there was a grand dinner party at Dorincourt. There had not been such a party at the
Castle for a long time. A few days before it took place, Sir Harry Lorridaile and Lady Lorridaile, who was the Earl's
only sister, actually came for a visit&mdash;a thing which caused the greatest excitement in the village and set Mrs.
Dibble's shop-bell tingling madly again, because it was well known that Lady Lorridaile had only been to Dorincourt once
since her marriage, thirty-five years before. She was a handsome old lady with white curls and dimpled, peachy cheeks,
and she was as good as gold, but she had never approved of her brother any more than did the rest of the world, and
having a strong will of her own and not being at all afraid to speak her mind frankly, she had, after several lively
quarrels with his lordship, seen very little of him since her young days.</p>

<p>She had heard a great deal of him that was not pleasant through the years in which they had been separated. She had
heard about his neglect of his wife, and of the poor lady's death; and of his indifference to his children; and of the
two weak, vicious, unprepossessing elder boys who had been no credit to him or to any one else. Those two elder sons,
Bevis and Maurice, she had never seen; but once there had come to Lorridaile Park a tall, stalwart, beautiful young
fellow about eighteen years old who had told her that he was her nephew Cedric Errol, and that he had come to see her
because he was passing near the place and wished to look at his Aunt Constantia of whom he had heard his mother speak.
Lady Lorridaile's kind heart had warmed through and through at the sight of the young man, and she had made him stay
with her a week, and petted him, and made much of him and admired him immensely. He was so sweet-tempered,
light-hearted, spirited a lad, that when he went away, she had hoped to see him often again; but she never did, because
the Earl had been in a bad humor when he went back to Dorincourt, and had forbidden him ever to go to Lorridaile Park
again. But Lady Lorridaile had always remembered him tenderly, and though she feared he had made a rash marriage in
America, she had been very angry when she heard how he had been cast off by his father and that no one really knew where
or how he lived. At last there came a rumor of his death, and then Bevis had been thrown from his horse and killed, and
Maurice had died in Rome of the fever; and soon after came the story of the American child who was to be found and
brought home as Lord Fauntleroy.</p>

<p>"Probably to be ruined as the others were," she said to her husband, "unless his mother is good enough and has a will
of her own to help her to take care of him."</p>

<p>But when she heard that Cedric's mother had been parted from him she was almost too indignant for words.</p>

<p>"It is disgraceful, Harry!" she said. "Fancy a child of that age being taken from his mother, and made the companion
of a man like my brother! The old Earl will either be brutal to the boy or indulge him until he is a little monster. If
I thought it would do any good to write&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't, Constantia," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"I know it wouldn't," she answered. "I know his lordship the Earl of Dorincourt too well;&mdash;but it is
outrageous."</p>

<p>Not only the poor people and farmers heard about little Lord Fauntleroy; others knew of him. He was talked about so
much and there were so many stories of him&mdash;of his beauty, his sweet temper, his popularity, and his growing
influence over the Earl, his grandfather&mdash;that rumors of him

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">[Pg 649]</a></span>

reached the gentry at their country places and he was heard of in more than one county of England. People talked about
him at the dinner tables, ladies pitied his young mother, and wondered if the boy were as handsome as he was said to be,
and men who knew the Earl and his habits laughed heartily at the stories of the little fellow's belief in his lordship's
amiability. Sir Thomas Asshe of Asshaine Hall, being in Erleboro one day, met the Earl and his grandson riding together
and stopped to shake hands with my lord and congratulate him on his change of looks and on his recovery from the gout.
"And, d'ye know!" he said, when he spoke of the incident afterward, "the old man looked as

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">[Pg 650]</a></span>

proud as a turkey-cock; and upon my word I don't wonder, for a handsomer, finer lad than his grandson I never saw! As straight as a dart, and sat
his pony like a young trooper!"</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 511px;">
<img src="images/illus658.jpg" width="511" height="600" alt="'I was thinking how beautiful you are,' said Lord Fauntleroy." title="" />
<span class="caption">"'I WAS THINKING HOW BEAUTIFUL YOU ARE,' SAID LORD FAUNTLEROY." (<a href="#Page_651">SEE PAGE 651.</a>)</span>
</div>

<p>And so by degrees Lady Lorridaile, too, heard of the child; she heard about Higgins, and the lame boy, and the
cottages at Earl's Court, and a score of other things,&mdash;and she began to wish to see the little fellow. And just as
she was wondering how it might be brought about, to her utter astonishment, she received a letter from her brother
inviting her to come with her husband to Dorincourt.</p>

<p>"It seems incredible!" she exclaimed. "I have heard it said that the child has worked miracles, and I begin to
believe it. They say my brother adores the boy and can scarcely endure to have him out of sight. And he is so proud of
him! Actually, I believe he wants to show him to us." And she accepted the invitation at once.</p>

<p>When she reached Dorincourt Castle with Sir Harry, it was late in the afternoon, and she went to her room at once
before seeing her brother. Having dressed for dinner she entered the drawing-room. The Earl was there standing near the
fire and looking very tall and imposing; and at his side stood a little boy in black velvet, and a large Vandyke collar
of rich lace&mdash;a little fellow whose round bright face was so handsome, and who turned upon her such beautiful,
candid brown eyes, that she almost uttered an exclamation of pleasure and surprise at the sight.</p>

<p>As she shook hands with the Earl, she called him by the name she had not used since her girlhood.</p>

<p>"What, Molyneux," she said, "is this the child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Constantia," answered the Earl, "this is the boy. Fauntleroy, this is your grand-aunt, Lady Lorridaile."</p>

<p>"How do you do, Grand-Aunt?" said Fauntleroy.</p>

<p>Lady Lorridaile put her hand on his shoulders, and after looking down into his upraised face a few seconds, kissed
him warmly.</p>

<p>"I am your Aunt Constantia," she said, "and I loved your poor papa, and you are very like him."</p>

<p>"It makes me glad when I am told I am like him," answered Fauntleroy, "because it seems as if every one liked
him,&mdash;just like Dearest, eszackly,&mdash;Aunt Constantia," (adding the two words after a second's pause.)</p>

<p>Lady Lorridaile was delighted. She bent and kissed him again, and from that moment they were warm friends.</p>

<p>"Well, Molyneux," she said aside to the Earl afterward, "it could not possibly be better than this!"</p>

<p>"I think not," answered his lordship dryly. "He is a fine little fellow. We are great friends. He believes me to be
the most charming and sweet-tempered of philanthropists. I will confess to you, Constantia,&mdash;as you would find it
out if I did not,&mdash;that I am in some slight danger of becoming rather an old fool about him."</p>

<p>"What does his mother think of you?" asked Lady Lorridaile, with her usual straightforwardness.</p>

<p>"I have not asked her," answered the Earl, slightly scowling.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lady Lorridaile, "I will be frank with you at the outset, Molyneux, and tell you I don't approve of your
course, and that it is my intention to call on Mrs. Errol as soon as possible; so if you wish to quarrel with me, you
had better mention it at once. What I hear of the young creature makes me quite sure that her child owes her everything.
We were told even at Lorridaile Park that your poorer tenants adore her already."</p>

<p>"They adore <em>him</em>," said the Earl, nodding toward Fauntleroy. "As to Mrs. Errol, you'll find her a pretty
little woman. I'm rather in debt to her for giving some of her beauty to the boy, and you can go to see her if you like.
All I ask is that she will remain at Court Lodge and that you will not ask me to go and see her," and he scowled a
little again.</p>

<p>"But he doesn't hate her as much as he used to, that is plain enough to me," her ladyship said to Sir Harry
afterward. "And he is a changed man in a measure, and, incredible as it may seem, Harry, it is my opinion that he is
being made into a human being, through nothing more nor less than his affection for that innocent, affectionate little
fellow. Why, the child actually loves him&mdash;leans on his chair and against his knee. My lord's own children would as
soon have thought of nestling up to a tiger."</p>

<p>The very next day she went to call upon Mrs. Errol. When she returned, she said to her brother:</p>

<p>"Molyneux, she is the loveliest little woman I ever saw! She has a voice like a silver bell, and you may thank her
for making the boy what he is. She has given him more than her beauty, and you make a great mistake in not persuading
her to come and take charge of you. I shall invite her to Lorridaile."</p>

<p>"She'll not leave the boy," replied the Earl.</p>

<p>"I must have the boy too," said Lady Lorridaile, laughing.</p>

<p>But she knew Fauntleroy would not be given up to her, and each day she saw more clearly how closely those two had
grown to each other, and how all the proud, grim old man's ambition and hope and love centered themselves in the child,
and how

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">[Pg 651]</a></span>

the warm, innocent nature returned his affection with most perfect trust and good faith.</p>

<p>She knew, too, that the prime reason for the great dinner party was the Earl's secret desire to show the world his
grandson and heir, and to let people see that the boy who had been so much spoken of and described was even a finer
little specimen of boyhood than rumor had made him.</p>

<p>"Bevis and Maurice were such a bitter humiliation to him," she said to her husband. "Every one knew it. He actually
hated them. His pride has full sway here." Perhaps there was not one person who accepted the invitation without feeling
some curiosity about little Lord Fauntleroy, and wondering if he would be on view.</p>

<p>And when the time came he was on view.</p>

<p>"The lad has good manners," said the Earl. "He will be in no one's way. Children are usually idiots or
bores,&mdash;mine were both,&mdash;but he can actually answer when he's spoken to, and be silent when he is not. He is
never offensive."</p>

<p>But he was not allowed to be silent very long. Every one had something to say to him. The fact was they wished to
make him talk. The ladies petted him and asked him questions, and the men asked him questions too, and joked with him,
as the men on the steamer had done when he crossed the Atlantic. Fauntleroy did not quite understand why they laughed so
sometimes when he answered them, but he was so used to seeing people amused when he was quite serious, that he did not
mind. He thought the whole evening delightful. The magnificent rooms were so brilliant with lights, there were so many
flowers, the gentlemen seemed so gay, and the ladies wore such beautiful, wonderful dresses, and such sparkling
ornaments in their hair and on their necks. There was one young lady who, he heard them say, had just come down from
London, where she had spent the "season"; and she was so charming that he could not keep his eyes from her. She was a
rather tall young lady with a proud little head, and very soft dark hair, and large eyes the color of purple pansies,
and the color on her cheeks and lips was like that of a rose. She was dressed in a beautiful white dress, and had pearls
around her throat. There was one strange thing about this young lady. So many gentlemen stood near her, and seemed
anxious to please her, that Fauntleroy thought she must be something like a princess. He was so much interested in her
that without knowing it he drew nearer and nearer to her and at last she turned and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Come here, Lord Fauntleroy," she said, smiling; "and tell me why you look at me so."</p>

<p>"I was thinking how beautiful you are," his young lordship replied.</p>

<p>Then all the gentlemen laughed outright, and the young lady laughed a little too, and the rose color in her cheeks
brightened.</p>

<p>"Ah, Fauntleroy," said one of the gentlemen who had laughed most heartily, "make the most of your time! When you are
older you will not have the courage to say that."</p>

<p>"But nobody could help saying it," said Fauntleroy sweetly. "Could you help it? Don't <em>you</em> think she is
pretty too?"</p>

<p>"We are not allowed to say what we think," said the gentleman, while the rest laughed more than ever.</p>

<p>But the beautiful young lady&mdash;her name was Miss Vivian Herbert&mdash;put out her hand and drew Cedric to her
side, looking prettier than before, if possible.</p>

<p>"Lord Fauntleroy shall say what he thinks," she said; "and I am much obliged to him. I am sure he thinks what he
says." And she kissed him on his cheek.</p>

<p>"I think you are prettier than any one I ever saw," said Fauntleroy, looking at her with innocent, admiring eyes,
"except Dearest. Of course, I couldn't think any one <em>quite</em> as pretty as Dearest. I think she is the prettiest
person in the world."</p>

<p>"I am sure she is," said Miss Vivian Herbert. And she laughed and kissed his cheek again.</p>

<p>She kept him by her side a great part of the evening, and the group of which they were the center was very gay. He
did not know how it happened, but before long he was telling them all about America, and the Republican Rally, and Mr.
Hobbs and Dick, and in the end he proudly produced from his pocket Dick's parting gift,&mdash;the red silk
handkerchief.</p>

<p>"I put it in my pocket to-night because it was a party," he said. "I thought Dick would like me to wear it at a
party."</p>

<p>And queer as the big, flaming, spotted thing was, there was a serious, affectionate look in his eyes, which prevented
his audience from laughing very much.</p>

<p>"You see I like it," he said, "because Dick is my friend."</p>

<p>But though he was talked to so much, as the Earl had said, he was in no one's way. He could be quiet and listen when
others talked, and so no one found him tiresome. A slight smile crossed more than one face when several times he went
and stood near his grandfather's chair, or sat on a stool close to him, watching him and absorbing every word he uttered
with the most charmed interest. Once he stood so near the chair's arm that his cheek touched the Earl's shoulder, and
his lordship, detecting the general smile, smiled a little

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">[Pg 652]</a></span>

himself. He knew what the lookers-on were thinking, and he felt some secret amusement in their seeing what a good friend
he was to this youngster, who might have been expected to share the popular opinion of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Havisham had been expected to arrive in the afternoon, but, strange to say, he was late. Such a thing had really
never been known to happen before during all the years in which he had been a visitor at Dorincourt Castle. He was so
late that the guests were on the point of rising to go in to dinner when he arrived. When he approached his host, the
Earl regarded him with amazement. He looked as if he had been hurried or agitated; his dry, keen old face was actually
pale.</p>

<p>"I was detained," he said, in a low voice to the Earl, "by&mdash;an extraordinary event."</p>

<p>It was as unlike the methodic old lawyer to be agitated by anything as it was to be late, but it was evident that he
had been disturbed. At dinner he ate scarcely anything, and two or three times, when he was spoken to, he started as if
his thoughts were far away. At dessert, when Fauntleroy came in, he looked at him more than once, nervously and
uneasily. Fauntleroy noted the look and wondered at it. He and Mr. Havisham were on friendly terms, and they usually
exchanged smiles. The lawyer seemed to have forgotten to smile that evening.</p>

<p>The fact was he forgot everything but the strange and painful news he knew he must tell the Earl before the night was
over&mdash;the strange news which he knew would be so terrible a shock, and which would change the face of everything.
As he looked about at the splendid rooms and the brilliant company,&mdash;at the people gathered together, he knew, more
that they might see the bright-haired little fellow near the Earl's chair than for any other reason,&mdash;as he looked
at the proud old man and at little Lord Fauntleroy smiling at his side, he really felt quite shaken, notwithstanding
that he was a hardened old lawyer. What a blow it was that he must deal them!</p>

<p>He did not exactly know how the long, superb dinner ended. He sat through it as if he were in a dream, and several
times he saw the Earl glance at him in surprise.</p>

<p>But it was over at last, and the gentlemen joined the ladies in the drawing-room. They found Fauntleroy sitting on a
sofa with Miss Vivian Herbert,&mdash;the great beauty of the last London season; they had been looking at some pictures,
and he was thanking his companion, as the door opened.</p>

<p>"I'm ever so much obliged to you for being so kind to me!" he was saying; "I never was at a party before, and I've
enjoyed myself so much!"</p>

<p>He had enjoyed himself so much that when the gentlemen gathered about Miss Herbert again and began to talk to her, as
he listened and tried to understand their laughing speeches, his eyelids began to droop. They drooped until they covered
his eyes two or three times, and then the sound of Miss Herbert's low, pretty laugh would bring him back, and he would
open them again for about two seconds. He was quite sure he was not going to sleep, but there was a large, yellow satin
cushion behind him and his head sank against it, and after a while his eyelids drooped for the last time. They did not
even quite open when, as it seemed a long time after, some one kissed him lightly on the cheek. It was Miss Vivian
Herbert, who was going away, and she spoke to him softly.</p>

<p>"Good-night, little Lord Fauntleroy," she said. "Sleep well."</p>

<p>And in the morning he did not know that he had tried to open his eyes and had murmured sleepily,</p>

<p>"Good-night&mdash;I'm so&mdash;glad&mdash;I saw you&mdash;you are so&mdash;pretty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He only had a very faint recollection of hearing the gentlemen laugh again and of wondering why they did it.</p>

<hr style="width:10%" />

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus664.jpg" width="100" height="151" alt="N" title="" /></div>

<p>o sooner had the last guest left the room, than Mr. Havisham turned from his place by the fire, and stepped nearer
the sofa, where he stood looking down at the sleeping occupant. Little Lord Fauntleroy was taking his ease luxuriously.
One leg crossed the other and swung over the edge of the sofa; one arm was flung easily above his head; the warm flush
of healthful, happy, childish sleep was on his quiet face; his waving tangle of bright hair strayed over the yellow
satin cushion. He made a picture well worth looking at.</p>

<p>As Mr. Havisham looked at it, he put his hand up and rubbed his shaven chin, with a harassed countenance.</p>

<p>"Well, Havisham," said the Earl's harsh voice behind him. "What is it? It is evident something has happened. What was
the extraordinary event, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>Mr. Havisham turned from the sofa, still rubbing his chin.</p>

<p>"It was bad news," he answered, "distressing news, my lord&mdash;the worst of news. I am sorry to be the bearer of
it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">[Pg 653]</a></span></p>

<p>The Earl had been uneasy for some time during the evening, as he glanced at Mr. Havisham, and when he was uneasy he
was always ill-tempered.</p>

<p>"Why do you look so at the boy!" he exclaimed irritably. "You have been looking at him all the evening as
if&mdash;See here now, why should you look at the boy, Havisham, and hang over him like some bird of ill-omen! What has
your news to do with Lord Fauntleroy?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Mr. Havisham, "I will waste no words. My news has everything to do with Lord Fauntleroy. And if we
are to believe it&mdash;it is not Lord Fauntleroy who lies sleeping before us, but only the son of Captain Errol. And
the present Lord Fauntleroy is the son of your son Bevis, and is at this moment in a lodging-house in London."</p>

<p>The Earl clutched the arms of his chair with both his hands until the veins stood out upon them; the veins stood out
on his forehead too; his fierce old face was almost livid.</p>

<p>"What do you mean!" he cried out. "You are mad! Whose lie is this?"</p>

<p>"If it is a lie," answered Mr. Havisham, "it is painfully like the truth. A woman came to my chambers this morning.
She said your son Bevis married her six years ago in London. She showed me her marriage certificate. They quarreled a
year after the marriage, and he paid her to keep away from him. She has a son five years old. She is an American of the
lower classes,&mdash;an ignorant person,&mdash;and until lately she did not fully understand what her son could claim.
She consulted a lawyer and found out that the boy was really Lord Fauntleroy and the heir to the earldom of Dorincourt;
and she, of course, insists on his claims being acknowledged."</p>

<p>There was a movement of the curly head on the yellow satin cushion. A soft, long, sleepy sigh came from the parted
lips, and the little boy stirred in his sleep, but not at all restlessly or uneasily. Not at all as if his slumber were
disturbed by the fact that he was being proved a small impostor and that he was not Lord Fauntleroy at all and never
would be the Earl of Dorincourt. He only turned his rosy face more on its side as if to enable the old man who stared at
it so solemnly to see it better.</p>

<p>The handsome, grim old face was ghastly. A bitter smile fixed itself upon it.</p>

<p>"I should refuse to believe a word of it," he said, "if it were not such a low, scoundrelly piece of business that it
becomes quite possible in connection with the name of my son Bevis. It is quite like Bevis. He was always a disgrace to
us. Always a weak, untruthful, vicious young brute with low tastes&mdash;my son and heir, Bevis, Lord Fauntleroy. The
woman is an ignorant, vulgar person, you say?"</p>

<p>"I am obliged to admit that she can scarcely spell her own name," answered the lawyer. "She is absolutely uneducated
and openly mercenary. She cares for nothing but the money. She is very handsome in a coarse way, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The fastidious old lawyer ceased speaking and gave a sort of shudder.</p>

<p>The veins on the old Earl's forehead stood out like purple cords. Something else stood out upon it too&mdash;cold
drops of moisture. He took out his handkerchief and swept them away. His smile grew even more bitter.</p>

<p>"And I," he said, "I objected to&mdash;to the other woman, the mother of this child" (pointing to the sleeping form
on the sofa); "I refused to recognize her. And yet she could spell her own name. I suppose this is retribution."</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room. Fierce and terrible words poured forth
from his lips. His rage and hatred and cruel disappointment shook him as a storm shakes a tree. His violence was
something dreadful to see, and yet Mr. Havisham noticed that at the very worst of his wrath he never seemed to forget
the little sleeping figure on the yellow satin cushions, and that he never once spoke loud enough to awaken it.</p>

<p>"I might have known it," he said. "They were a disgrace to me from their first hour! I hated them both; and they
hated me! Bevis was the worse of the two. I will not believe this yet, though! I will contend against it to the last.
But it is like Bevis&mdash;it is like him!"</p>

<p>And then he raged again and asked questions about the woman, about her proofs, and pacing the room, turned first
white and then purple in his repressed fury.</p>

<p>When at last he had learned all there was to be told, and knew the worst, Mr. Havisham looked at him with a feeling
of anxiety. He looked broken and haggard and changed. His rages had always been bad for him, but this one had been worse
than the rest because there had been something more than rage in it.</p>

<p>He came slowly back to the sofa, at last, and stood near it.</p>

<p>"If any one had told me I could be fond of a child," he said, his harsh voice low and unsteady, "I should not have
believed them. I always detested children&mdash;my own more than the rest. I am fond of this one; he is fond of me,"
(with a bitter smile.) "I am not popular; I never was. But he is fond of me. He never was afraid of me&mdash;he always
trusted me. He would have filled my place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">[Pg 654]</a></span>
better than I have filled it. I know that. He would have been an honor to the name."</p>

<p>He bent down and stood a minute or so looking at the happy, sleeping face. His shaggy eyebrows were knitted fiercely,
and yet somehow he did not seem fierce at all. He put up his hand, pushed the bright hair back from the forehead, and
then turned away and rang the bell.</p>

<p>When the largest footman appeared, he pointed to the sofa.</p>

<p>"Take"&mdash;he said, and then his voice changed a little&mdash;"take Lord Fauntleroy to his room."</p>

<h2>FLY-FISHING FOR TROUT.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Ripley Hitchcock.</span></h3>

<p>There was once a boy who thought that he could choose his birthday present more wisely than could his father and
mother. He wanted an "arrow rifle"&mdash;a useless affair which has long since gone to the place where toys which are
failures go. He was disappointed however. His birthday brought him not an "arrow rifle," but a light, jointed
fishing-rod. Now this boy had already done some fishing with a heavy bamboo pole, or with one cut from an alder, jerking
the fish out of the water, and swinging them over his head. To be sure the heavy pole made his arms ache, but his new
rod, which bent at every touch, seemed to him too slender and flimsy to be of any use whatever.</p>

<p>I fear he was not very grateful at first, but he was properly rebuked when his father took a day from professional
cares, and opened the lad's eyes to the pleasure of fishing with light tackle. When he had learned to "cast" flies with
his elastic, strong rod, without hooking somebody or something not meant to be hooked; when he had seen the beautiful
vermilion-spotted trout flash clear of the water, tempted by the flies; and when he had found that he could tire out and
land larger fish than he had ever caught before, simply by pitting against their cunning and strength, skill and
patience instead of mere brute force,&mdash;then there was opened to that boy a new world of sport and healthy
recreation. He has never regretted the "arrow rifle"; and he now proposes to tell the boys as well as the girls who read
<span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> how to obtain something which is within the reach of both,&mdash;the greatest
possible pleasure from fishing.</p>

<p>If one could take a bird's-eye view of our country
at any time in the summer, he would see boys
and girls catching all kinds of fish in all kinds of
ways; some off the coast in sailboats, tugging at
bluefish or mackerel, others profiting by <span class="smcap">St.
Nicholas's</span> lessons in black-bass fishing, some
"skittering" for pickerel in New England lakes,
others trolling for pike in the lakes and rivers of the
West. But of all the fresh-water game fish there
is none more beautiful and graceful or more active
than the trout.</p>

<span class="caption">RAINBOW TROUT.</span>
</div>

<p>Any New York boy who has never caught a trout should go down to Fulton Market at the opening of the trout season,
when trout are gathered there from all parts of the country. He will see "rainbow" trout from the Rocky Mountains, their
sides iridescent, and stained as if marked by a bloody finger. These are being introduced into Eastern waters. He will
find trout in the blackest of mourning robes and others gayly dressed in silver tinsel. Sometimes the vermilion spots on
the side shine like fire; again they are as dull as if the fire had gone out and left only gray ashes. For there are
several varieties of trout known to naturalists and traveled fishermen, and even the brook trout, called by the
formidable name of <em>Salmo fontinalis</em>, varies greatly in color and shape in different localities. In Arizona, I
have caught trout which were fairly black. In Dublin Lake in New Hampshire, the trout look like bars of polished silver
as they are drawn up through the water. I never saw a more sharply marked contrast than that between the trout of two
little Maine lakes, near the head-waters of the Androscoggin River. In one, the trout were long, and as thin as
race-horses, and their flesh was of a salmon-pink hue; in the other, not half a mile away, the trout were short, thick,
and almost hump-backed, with darker skins and lighter flesh. The first lake had a sandy, gravelly bottom, and the water
was clear as crystal; the bottom of the second was muddy, and the water dark and turbid. This explained the difference
in the fish, a difference always existing in trout of brooks or lakes under the same conditions.</p>

<span class="caption"><em>Trout-rod and Tackle</em>.</span>
</div>
<p>In the great Androscoggin Lakes of Maine, the trout, which are brook trout, grow to the largest size known anywhere.
They have been caught weighing twelve pounds, and many claimed that

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">[Pg 656]</a></span>

they were lake trout, until the famous naturalist Agassiz decided that, although living in lakes, they were true brook
trout. These immense trout have very thick bodies and cruel hooked jaws; but the guides can point out many contrasts
between trout from different lakes, or even from different parts of the same lake. There are trout nearly as large in
the rivers of the British Provinces, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Quebec, but these are usually lighter colored, and
they are quite another variety, being known as sea trout, or <em>Salmo trutta</em>. All this adds to the interest of
trout-fishing by inducing the angler to acquaint himself with what the Natural Histories have to tell him about the
various kinds of trout. Then the differences in one kind teach him to be observant and excite a curiosity as to the
habits of the trout. Here the Natural Histories will fail him. Only by following trout brooks and tempting the larger
trout of lakes, can he properly study the ways and curious moods of this cunning, timid fish. And even then, if he be
modest, he will often confess himself sadly puzzled; for the trout's wits are sometimes more than a match for the
fisherman's. And this adds to the pleasure of trout-fishing; for if one had to deal with a fish which would bite at any
bait, under any circumstances, and give up the fight as soon as hooked, the sport would soon grow very stupid. In
trout-fishing, one will study the best conditions of wind, weather, and water, and learn how to approach one of the
shyest of fish, how to delude one of the most wary, and how safely to land one of the pluckiest. To do this it is
necessary to have reliable "tackle," a term which includes rod, reel, line, leaders, flies, and landing net. The rod
must be so light that one can cast with it easily and persistently, and yet it must be strong enough to bend into all
manner of curves without breaking, and to tire out large trout. If it is too stiff, the fisherman's arm will soon be
wearied, and if it is too flexible or withy, it will not cast flies well, and it will not hold fish firmly if the angler
needs to bring a strain upon them. In attempts to meet these requirements, fly rods have been made of split bamboo, ash
and lance-ood, bethabara, greenheart, cedar, hickory, hornbeam, iron-wood, snake-wood, shadblow and perhaps twenty other
woods, and there have even been experiments in making rods of thin steel tubes. The split bamboo rods are made of four
or six triangular strips cut from the rind of Calcutta bamboo and carefully fitted and glued together. Sometimes the
surface is rounded, but oftener it has six sides. These rods, when they are really good, are the best of all. Indeed,
Americans may justly claim to make the finest rods in the world and also the finest lines. But I should not advise any
of my readers to buy a split bamboo fly rod, because these rods are very expensive, they require very careful treatment,
and if broken they must go back to the maker to be repaired. The fly rod which I recommend to the boys and girls of
<span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> is one with an ash butt, and the second joint and tip of lance-wood. It should
be from ten feet to ten feet and a half in length, and should weigh about seven ounces and a half. Such a rod can be
obtained from any reliable dealer in any large city. I emphasize reliable because there are fishing-tackle stores where
one may get rods nice to look at, but worthless to use. Nearly all dealers keep what is called an "all around" rod,
intended to be used, for either fly or bait fishing, but this, like most compromises is usually unsatisfactory. This, or
something like it, will probably be shown you if you ask for a boy's rod, so that it is better to tell the dealer or
rod-maker exactly what you want, and to accept nothing else. If he takes a pride in his work and has a reputation to
sustain, he will interest himself in picking out a rod of sound, well-seasoned wood, evenly balanced, elastic, with a
good action, and a peculiar "kick" in the second joint, which is of great service in casting a fly. If

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">[Pg 657]</a></span>

some one can help you in making your choice, so much the better. Then it will be well to attach a reel and line to the
rod and try it in actual casting, if this is possible; and when the rod is bent, see that the bend is an even curve. The
pleasure of fly-fishing depends upon the quality of the rod, and the choice should therefore be made deliberately and
wisely. Some fishermen make their own rods, and there are dealers who supply materials for amateur rod-makers; but this
is a difficult undertaking and can not be described here.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> I should advise any boy to go to a professional maker for
his first fly rod.</p>

<span class="caption">YOUNG ANGLERS.</span>
</div>

<p>The "enameled water-proof" lines are the best. These are braided from boiled silk, and prepared to resist the action
of water, which will cause the decay of an ordinary line. Of the various sizes, which are distinguished by letters, that
known as F is perhaps most desirable, although either E or F will answer the purpose. The line should be "level," not
tapering, and at least twenty-five yards in length. This will be wound upon a "click" reel of equal capacity, preferably
nickel-plated. But this is of less importance than the internal construction of the reel, for which you should have the
maker's guarantee. Now come the flies. There are names enough to fill a directory, and a greater variety of colors than
the woods show in autumn. A few flies like the "Montreal," "Professor," "Scarlet Ibis," "Coachman," and "the Hackles,"
are to be found in almost every angler's book. For the rest, it will be well to learn, from some experienced angler or
intelligent dealer, the flies best suited to the particular waters which you intend to fish. At the Rangeley lakes, for
example, you will find that large, gaudy flies are much used, like the "Parmachenee Belle," "Silver and Golden Doctor,"
and "Grizzly King," and there is one local fly called the "Katoodle Bug." In the Adirondacks, smaller flies of quieter
colors are favored. For brook-fishing, very small flies of neutral tints are much used except when the water is very
dark. A fly-book will be needed to contain flies and also leaders. The leader is a piece of "silk-worm gut," which
should be about six feet in length. One end is fastened to the line, and the stretcher-fly is made fast at the other.
One or two other flies, called droppers, are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">[Pg 658]</a></span>

usually attached at intervals of two feet or more along the leader. Before making your choice, the leaders should be
closely examined to see whether any part is frayed or cracked. They can be tested by a pull of four or five pounds on a
spring balance. The leader is used as being less conspicuous than the line in the water, and, therefore, less likely to
frighten away trout approaching the flies. Most leaders are dyed a misty bluish color which, it is thought, will escape
even the keen eyes of the trout. A landing-net, the size and strength of which depend upon the fishing-ground, completes
the list of tackle.</p>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus673.jpg" width="400" height="167" alt="Trout Flies." title="" />
<span class="caption">TROUT FLIES.</span>
</div>

<p>The next step is to learn how to cast a fly, and here practice and the advice of some experienced fly-fisherman will
be worth more than printed instructions.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to wait for summer nor for access to water, in order to practice casting. A housetop, a
dooryard, or even the spacious floor of an old-fashioned barn, as the case may be, offers just as good a chance for
practice as a lake or river. When the rod is jointed together, the reel attached, and the line passed through the rings
and beyond the tip about the length of the rod, the learner is usually seized with a wild desire to flourish rod and
line like a whip with a long snapper. This feeling must promptly be suppressed. Fly-casting is a very simple movement,
and not a flourish. The elbow is kept down at the side, the forearm moving only a little, and most of the work is done
by the wrist. Holding the rod by the "grip," the part of the butt wound with silk or rattan to assist the grasp, one
finds that the reel, which is just below the "grip," aids in balancing the rod. The reel is underneath in casting. After
hooking a fish, many anglers turn their rods so as to bring the reel to the upper side, thus letting the strain of the
line come upon the rod itself instead of upon the rings. In holding the "grip," the thumb should be extended straight
along the rod, as this gives an additional "purchase." For the first cast, take the end of the line in the left hand,
and bring the rod upward and backward until the line is taut. As you release the line, the spring of the rod carries the
line backward. This is the back cast. Then comes an instant's pause, while the line straightens itself out behind, and
then, with a firm motion of the wrist, helped a little by the forearm, the rod is thrown forward, and the line flies
easily out in front. Begin with a line once or once-and-a-half as long as the rod, and lengthen it out by degrees. The
main points to be remembered are: to keep the elbow at the side, to train the wrist, to move the rod not too far forward
or back, always to wait until the line is straight behind on the back cast, and to make sure that in this the line falls
no lower than your head, a process which it will take time to accomplish. There is no more awkward fault than that of
whipping a rod down to a level with the horizon before and behind, and swishing the flies through the air until some of
them are snapped off.</p>

<p>When the learner becomes accustomed to handling his rod, he must try to perfect himself in two matters of great
importance&mdash;accuracy and delicacy. Place a small piece of paper fifteen or twenty feet away, and aim at making the
knot in the end of the line fall easily and quietly upon it. Your efforts will be aided if you will raise the point of
the rod a trifle, just as the forward impulse of the line is spent, and the line itself is straightened in the air for
an instant in front. This is a novel kind of target-shooting, but its usefulness will be realized when the angler finds
it necessary to drop his flies so lightly just over the head of some particularly wary trout, that the fish, although
too shy or lazy to move a yard, will be persuaded that some tempting natural flies have foolishly settled on the water
just within reach of his jaws. By practice of this kind, which is an excellent form of light exercise in itself, any boy
or girl can learn a very fascinating art. It is not necessary to make very long casts. At fly-casting tournaments in
Central Park, casts have been made of about ninety feet, but in actual fishing a third of that distance is usually
sufficient. Never cast more line than you can conveniently and safely handle.</p>

<span class="caption">CAPTURING TWO FISH AT ONCE,&mdash;OR "LANDING A DOUBLE."</span>
</div>

<p>And now that we are ready to go a-fishing, the question arises, "Where shall we go?" The cold, bitter weather common
in early April is not favorable to fishermen or fish. When May sunshine brings the leaves out on the trees, and fields
are

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">[Pg 659]</a></span>

green and skies are blue, then Long Island may well tempt any New York boy who has a holiday to spend in fly-fishing.
Years ago, any Long Island water could be fished without question, but now nearly all the Long Island brooks and ponds
are "preserved,"&mdash;that is, kept for personal use by clubs or private owners. A boy who has a friend or relative
among the owners of these preserves, or can hire a fishing privilege, can enjoy trout-fishing within a journey of two or
three hours from his New York home. Within a few hours' ride, also, are trout streams in the southern counties of New
York State and in Pennsylvania, although the former are so often visited that the fish have not time to grow large. The
New England boy finds trout brooks in western Connecticut, in northern Massachusetts, and in the Cape Cod region, in
northern New Hampshire and Vermont, and especially in Maine. Once, almost every stream and lake in New England contained
trout. But forests were cut down, and some of the streams dwindled until they went dry in summer. Saw-mills were built,
the streams were dammed up so as to be impassable for trout, and the trout eggs were buried under sawdust. Manufactories
have poisoned the water of some rivers and others have been literally "fished dry." The

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">[Pg 660]</a></span>

trout of any brook near a large New England town have a very poor chance of long life. All this is discouraging enough,
but yet there are trout to be caught, as every New England boy knows.</p>

<p>The most famous fishing-places in the East are the Rangeley Lakes in Maine and the Adirondacks in New York. About the
third week of May the ice goes out of the great chain of lakes forming the head-waters of the Androscoggin River in
Maine. Then the red-shirted river-drivers come down with "drives" of logs, which dash through the sluiceways of immense
dams between the different lakes. And while the brown pine trunks are still shooting through the dams, fishermen begin
to gather from all parts of the country, for in the clear cold water of these lakes the trout, feeding upon myriads of
minnows, grow to be the giants of their race. I can wish no better piscatorial fortune for the children of <span
class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> than a visit to Maine with father or brother, and the capture of one of these large
trout. I must confess, however, that the large trout are not to be depended upon; but there are small fish always to be
caught in the little lakes and brooks of the region, and there are pleasant forest camps with cheerful fires blazing in
great stone fireplaces. The host of one of these camps was for a long time a hunter and guide, and every winter he
lectures before Boston schoolboys, dressed in his hunter's garb, and tells them about trapping and the adventures of
life in the woods.</p>

<span class="caption">INTERIOR OF A FISHING-CAMP.</span>
</div>

<p>If one can continue further into the North-east, better fishing can be found in New Brunswick and Quebec than in
Maine, although the trout of the Provinces are sea trout, a distinction which does not seem to me important. The trout
of the Adirondacks are much smaller than those of Maine or New Brunswick, and now that the Adirondack country is overrun
with visitors, one must go back some distance into the woods to find good sport. South of Pennsylvania, there is
trout-fishing in the mountain streams of West Virginia and North Carolina. To the west, northern Michigan tempts the
angler, and still further north are the large trout of the Nepigon river which flows into Lake Superior. The States
along the Mississippi Valley are sadly deficient in trout, but a great deal can be done with black bass, as Mr. Maurice
Thompson has told you. Trout abound all along the Rocky Mountains. There are the lusty five-pounders of the Snake River
in Idaho, the rainbow trout of California, found also, I think, in Colorado, and the dusky fish of New Mexico and
Arizona. I do not expect that many of <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas's</span> readers will visit these remote
fishing-places, but between the three corners of the continent in which I have caught trout&mdash;Quebec, Washington
Territory, and Arizona&mdash;there are so many chances for trout-fishing, that very few need fail to enjoy this most
delightful of outdoor sports.</p>

<p>The best month for fly-fishing is June, and the best weather a light southerly or southwesterly breeze and a slightly
overcast sky. Morning or evening is the best time. The worst is the middle of an intensely hot, bright, still day. It is
usually thought that a change in the weather makes trout more active. Very high or very low water is undesirable. Yet
when all the conditions seem perfect, one may cast over a whole school of trout without inducing them to stir a fin; and
on the other hand, when the weather is most unfavorable and when the fish are gorged with food, they will, sometimes,
fairly hustle one another in their eagerness to get the flies. On one hot July noon, the air and water around my boat
were alive with trout for half an hour, when they stopped rising as suddenly as they had begun, without any apparent
reason in one

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">[Pg 661]</a></span>

case or the other. Within two forenoon hours, I once caught twenty-five pounds of trout at the mouth of a brook emptying
into one of the Rangeley lakes. Early next morning, I was rowed to the same spot and found only one solitary trout. On
another occasion, I landed a five-pound and a three-pound trout from a pool in a Canadian river, without unduly
disturbing the water; but although the pool contained several other fish, including one estimated to weigh over five
pounds, not another trout could be induced to look at any fly in my book. Trout are very fickle and changeable, and the
ingenuity sometimes required to coax them to rise adds as much zest to the sport as the suspense and excitement of
hooking and landing them.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus676.jpg" width="600" height="313" alt="A Mountain Lake." title="" />
<span class="caption">A MOUNTAIN LAKE.</span>
</div>

<p>But when the trout does rise, what do you suppose he thinks? Does he really believe that the curious creature with a
barbed tail hovering over his head is a natural fly? I doubt it. The flies ordinarily used would drive an entomologist
to distraction. The great scarlet and white and yellow flies which have caused so many Rangeley lake trout to come to
grief are, I fancy, unlike any living insect in that region, or anywhere else. The trout sees something moving on the
water, and as experience has taught him that such fluttering objects are usually good to eat, his weakness for live food
tempts him to pounce upon it without stopping to reason out the matter. But when he finds that this deceitful fly is
entirely tasteless, he will drop it at once, unless the fisherman is prompt in "striking." This means a quick upward
movement of the tip of the rod, a motion imparted, of course, at the butt, but communicated along rod and line. The
movement "strikes" the hook into the fish. One can not be too quick in striking, but if too much force be used, the rod
may be snapped at the second joint. Yet that is not the way in which rods are most frequently broken. If you have drawn
in your flies so closely that you can not readily recover them, and your rod is pointing nearly straight upward, even a
gentle attempt to strike a small fish is likely to break a rod. Once, I was fishing with a heavy rod from a raft which
was drifting across a Canadian lake. The wind was so strong that I was obliged to cast with it, and then the raft
rapidly drifted down upon my flies. A trout weighing not a quarter of a pound rose when my rod was nearly perpendicular,
and the flies were close before me; instinctively I struck. The reward of my carelessness was that the rod, which would
have landed a ten-pound fish, was cleanly broken into two pieces. Never draw the flies so near you that you have not
safe and complete control of your rod, either for the back cast or for a strike.</p>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus677.jpg" width="400" height="321" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The importance of the high back cast of which I have spoken, will be especially appreciated by <span
class="smcap">St. Nicholas's</span> boys and girls, for most of their trout-fishing will probably be done upon brooks
where a low back cast would involve entanglement in grass or bushes. In brook-fishing it is usually necessary to use a
comparatively short line, and one must learn to make under-hand casts,&mdash;that is, with the rod down to a horizontal
level on either side, instead of being upright, something easily

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">[Pg 662]</a></span>

learned after one can cast properly over-hand. Of course my readers will see that they must keep themselves and their
shadows out of the sight of the timid trout. When a fish is hooked, let him run out the reel if he is large enough,
unless he makes for stumps or brush where the line may get entangled. Then as much of a strain must be brought to bear
upon him as the tackle will withstand; and always reel in line when it is possible. The line should never be slack. If
the trout will not rise at first, change your flies and try the old rule of looking closely at the insects which hover
over the water and selecting a fly from your book that imitates those insects as nearly as possible. The best general
rule is to use small dark flies in bright, clear water, and larger bright flies in dark or turbid water. I need hardly
say that fish are not to be lifted out of the water with a fly-rod. Let the trout run and struggle until the strain of
the rod tires him out so that he can be easily drawn within reach and lifted out with the landing-net.</p>

<p>So you see that in fly-fishing for trout you learn a very fascinating art, which can be practiced among the most
delightful of outdoor surroundings in the pleasantest months of the year. You will learn much more than books can tell
you about the habits and curious ways of a fish which the most experienced anglers have considered for hundreds of years
as, next to the salmon, their most worthy game. You will learn patience, perseverance, and all manner of practical
lessons on trout streams, including the tying of knots and the repairing of rods. And the sunshine, the fragrance of
flowery meadows, and the cool breath of the woods will give you a health which can not be found indoors. But let me urge
upon you to remember that the true sportsman is always generous in his treatment of the noble fish which he pursues. He
will never catch trout out of season. He will never kill more trout than can be made use of, nor will he ever kill them
by unfair means. And he will never catch tiny troutlings, too small to afford sport, lest he should exhaust the streams,
but he will carefully restore to the water any trout which are not at least six inches long. <span class="smcap">St.
Nicholas's</span> fly-fishers who meet the gallant trout on fair and even terms will surely give the beautiful fish
honorable treatment.</p>

<p>And when you go a-fishing, bearing these words in mind, may you be rewarded by baskets well filled with trout of
noble size.</p>

<h2>GEORGE WASHINGTON.</h2>
<h4>[<em>An Historical Biography.</em>]</h4>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Horace E. Scudder.</span></h3>
<h4>CHAPTER XVII.</h4>
<h5>AT VALLEY FORGE.</h5>

<p>The winter of 1777 passed with little fighting; and when the spring opened, Washington used his army so adroitly as
to prevent the British from moving on Philadelphia, and finally crowded them out of New Jersey altogether. That summer,
however, was an anxious one, for there was great uncertainty as to the plans of the enemy; and when at last a formidable
British army appeared in the Chesapeake, whither it had been transported by sea, Washington hurried his forces to meet
it, and fought the battle of Brandywine, in which he met with a severe loss. He retrieved his fortune in part by a
brilliant attack on the enemy at Germantown, and then retired to Valley Forge, in Pennsylvania, where he went into
winter quarters; while the British army was comfortably established in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>The defeat of Burgoyne by Gates, at Saratoga, in the summer and Washington's splendid attack at Germantown had made a
profound impression in Europe, and are counted as having turned the scale in favor of an alliance with the United States
on the part of France. But when the winter shut down on the American army, no such good cheer encouraged it. That winter
of 1778 was the most terrible ordeal which the army endured, and one has but to read of the sufferings of the soldiers
to learn at how great a cost independence was bought. It is worth while to tell again the familiar story, because the
leader of the army himself shared the want and privation of the men. To read of Valley Forge is to read of
Washington.</p>

<p>The place was chosen for winter quarters because of its position. It was equally distant with Philadelphia from the
Brandywine and from the ferry across the Delaware into New Jersey. It was too far from Philadelphia to be in peril from
attack, and yet it was so near that the American army could, if opportunity offered, descend quickly on the city. Then
it was so protected by hills and streams that the addition of a few lines of fortification made it very secure.</p>

<p>But there was no town at Valley Forge, and it became necessary to provide some shelter for the soldiers other than
the canvas tents which served in the field in summer. It was the middle of December when the army began preparations for
the winter, and Washington gave directions for the building of the little village. The men were divided into parties of
twelve, each party to build a hut to accommodate that number; and in order to stimulate the men, Washington promised a
reward of twelve dollars to the party in each regiment which finished its hut first and most satisfactorily. And as
there was some difficulty in getting boards, he offered a hundred dollars to any officer or soldier who should invent
some substitute which would be as cheap as boards and as quickly provided.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus680.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="Building The Huts At Valley Forge." title="" />
<span class="caption">BUILDING THE HUTS AT VALLEY FORGE.</span>
</div>

<p>Each hut was to be fourteen feet by sixteen, the sides, ends, and roof to be made of logs, and the sides made tight
with clay. There was to be a fireplace in the rear of each hut, built of wood, but lined with clay eighteen inches
thick. The walls were to be six and a half feet high. Huts

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">[Pg 664]</a></span>

were also to be provided for the officers, and to be placed in the rear of those occupied by the troops. All these were
to be regularly arranged in streets. A visitor to the camp when the huts were being built, wrote of the army; "They
appear to me like a family of beavers, every one busy; some carrying logs, others mud, and the rest plastering them
together." It was bitterly cold, and for a month the men were at work, making ready for the winter.</p>

<p>But in what sort of condition were the men themselves when they began this work? Here is a picture of one of those
men on his way to Valley Forge: "His bare feet peep through his worn-out shoes, his legs nearly naked from the tattered
remains of an only pair of stockings, his breeches not enough to cover his nakedness, his shirt hanging in strings, his
hair disheveled, his face wan and thin, his look hungry, his whole appearance that of a man forsaken and neglected." And
the snow was falling! This was one of the privates. The officers were scarcely better off. One was wrapped "in a sort of
dressing-gown made of an old blanket or woolen bed-cover." The uniforms were torn and ragged; the guns were rusty; a few
only had bayonets; the soldiers carried their powder in tin boxes and cow-horns.</p>

<p>To explain why this army was so poor and forlorn, would be to tell a long story. It may be summed up briefly in these
words&mdash;the army was not taken care of because there was no country to take care of it. There were thirteen States,
and each of these States sent troops into the field, but all the States were jealous of one another. There was a
Congress, which undertook to direct the war, but all the members of Congress, coming from the several States, were
jealous of one another. They were agreed on only one thing&mdash;that it was not prudent to give the army too much
power. It is true that they had once given Washington large authority, but they had given it only for a short period.
They were very much afraid that somehow the army would rule the country, and yet they were trying to free the country
from the rule of England. But when they talked about freeing the country, each man thought only of his own State. The
first fervor with which they had talked about a common country had died away; there were some very selfish men in
Congress, who could not be patriotic enough to think of the whole country.</p>

<p>The truth is, it takes a long time for the people of a country to come to feel that they have a country. Up to the
time of the war for independence, the people in America did not care much for one another or for America. They had
really been preparing to be a nation, but they did not know it. They were angry with Great Britain, and they knew they
had been wronged. They were therefore ready to fight; but it does not require so much courage to fight as to endure
suffering and to be patient.</p>

<p>So it was that the people of America who were most conscious that they were Americans were the men who were in the
army, and their wives and mothers and sisters at home. All these were making sacrifices for their country and so
learning to love it. The men in the army came from different States, and there was a great deal of State feeling among
them; but, after all, they belonged to one army, the continental army, and they had much more in common than they had
separately. Especially they had a great leader who made no distinction between Virginians and New England men.
Washington felt keenly all the lack of confidence which Congress showed. He saw that the spirit in Congress was one
which kept the people divided, while the spirit at Valley Forge kept the people united, and he wrote reproachfully to
Congress:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"If we would pursue a right system of policy, in my opinion, ... we should all, Congress and
army, be considered as one people, embarked in one cause, in one interest; acting on the same principle, and to the same
end. The distinction, the jealousies set up, or perhaps only incautiously let out, can answer not a single good
purpose.... No order of men in the thirteen States has paid a more sacred regard to the proceedings of Congress than the
army; for without arrogance or the smallest deviation from truth it may be said, that no history now extant can furnish
an instance of an army's suffering such uncommon hardships as ours has done, and bearing them with the same patience and
fortitude. To see men, without clothes to cover them, without blankets to lie on, without shoes (for the want of which
their marches might be traced by the blood from their feet), and almost as often without provisions as with them,
marching through the frost and snow, and at Christmas taking up their winter quarters within a day's march of the enemy,
without a house or hut to cover them, till they could be built, and submitting without a murmur, is a proof of patience
and obedience, which, in my opinion, can scarce be paralleled."</p>

<p>The horses died of starvation, and the men harnessed themselves to trucks and sleds, hauling wood and provisions from
storehouse to hut. At one time there was not a ration in camp. Washington seized the peril with a strong hand and
compelled the people in the country about, who had been selling to the British army at Philadelphia, to give up their
stores to the patriots at Valley Forge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wives of the officers came to the camp, and these brave women gave of their cheer to its dreary life.
Mrs. Washington was there with her husband. "The General's apartment is very small," she wrote to a friend; "he has had
a log cabin built to dine in, which has made our quarters much more tolerable than they were at first."</p>

<p>The officers and their wives came together and

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">[Pg 665]</a></span>

told stories, perhaps over a plate of hickory nuts, which, we are informed, furnished General Washington's dessert. The
General was cheerful in the little society; but his one thought was how to keep the brave company of men alive and
prepare them for what lay before them. The house where he had his quarters was a farmhouse belonging to a quaker, Mr.
Potts, who has said that one day when strolling up the creek, away from the camp, he heard a deep, quiet voice a little
way off. He went nearer, and saw Washington's horse tied to a sapling. Hard by, in the thicket, was Washington on his
knees, praying earnestly.</p>

<span class="caption">AT VALLEY FORGE.</span>
</div>

<p>At the end of February, light began to break. The terrible winter was passing away, though the army was still in
wretched state. But there came to camp, a volunteer, Baron Steuben, who had been trained in the best armies of Europe.
In him Washington had, what he greatly needed, an excellent drill-master. He made him Inspector of the army, and soon,
as if by magic, the men changed from slouching, careless fellows into erect, orderly soldiers. The Baron began with a
picked company of one hundred and twenty men, whom he drilled thoroughly; these became the models for others, and so the
whole camp was turned into a military school.</p>

<p>The prospect grew brighter and brighter, until on the 4th of May, late at night, a messenger rode into camp with
dispatches from Congress. Washington opened them, and his heart must have leaped for joy as he read that an alliance had
been formed between France and the United States. Two days later, the army celebrated the event. The chaplains of the
several regiments read the intelligence and then offered up thanksgiving to God. Guns were fired, and there was a public
dinner in honor of Washington and his generals. There had been shouts for the King of France and for the American
States; but when Washington took his leave, "there was," says an officer who was present, universal applause, "with loud
huzzas, which continued till he had proceeded a quarter of a mile, during which time there were a thousand hats tossed
in the air. His excellency turned round with his retinue, and huzzaed several times."</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XVIII.</h4>
<h5>THE CONWAY CABAL.</h5>

<p>There is no man so high but some will always be found who wish to pull him down. Washington was no exception to this
rule. His men worshiped him; the people had confidence in him; the officers nearest to him, and especially those who
formed a part of his military family, were warmly attached to him; but in Congress there were men who violently opposed
him, and there were certain generals who not only envied him but were ready to seize any opportunity which might offer
to belittle him and to place one of their own number in his place. The chief men who were engaged in this business were
Generals Conway, Mifflin, and Gates, and from the prominent position taken in the affair by the first-named officer, the
intrigue against Washington goes by the name of the Conway Cabal. A "cabal" is a secret combination against a person
with the object of his hurt or injury.</p>

<p>It is not easy to say just how or when this cabal first showed itself. Conway was a young brigadier-general, very
conceited and impudent. Mifflin had been Quartermaster-general, but had resigned. He had been early in the service and
was in Cambridge with Washington, but had long been secretly hostile to him. Gates, who had been Washington's companion
in Virginia, was an ambitious man who never lost an opportunity of looking after his own interest, and had been
especially fortunate in being appointed to the command of the northern army just as it achieved the famous victory over
Burgoyne.</p>

<p>The defeat at Brandywine, the failure to make Germantown a great success, and the occupation of Philadelphia by the
British troops, while the American army was suffering at Valley Forge&mdash;all this seemed to many a sorry story
compared with the brilliant victory at Saratoga. There had always been those who thought Washington slow and cautious.
John Adams was one of these, and he expressed himself as heartily glad "that the glory of turning the tide of arms was
not immediately due to the commander-in-chief." Others shook their heads and said that the people of America had been
guilty of idolatry by making a man their god; and that, besides, the army would become dangerous to the liberties of the
people if it were allowed to be so influenced by one man.</p>

<p>Conway was the foremost of these critics. "No man was more a gentleman than General Washington, or appeared to more
advantage at his table, or in the usual intercourse of life," he would say; then he would give his shoulders a shrug,
and look around and add, "but as to his talents for the command of an army, they were miserable indeed."</p>

<p>"Gates was the general!" Conway said. "There was a man who could fight, and win victories!"</p>

<p>Gates himself was in a mood to believe it. He had been so intoxicated by his success against Burgoyne that he thought
himself the man of the day, and quite forgot to send a report of the action to his commander-in-chief. Washington
rebuked him in a letter which was severe in its quiet tone. He congratulated Gates on his great success, and added, "At
the same time, I can not but regret that a matter of such magnitude, and so interesting to our general operations,
should have reached me by report only; or through the channel of letters not bearing that authenticity which the
importance of it required, and which it would have received by a line over your signature stating the simple fact."</p>

<p>Gates may have winced under the rebuke, but he was then listening to Conway's flattery, and that was more agreeable
to him. Conway, on his part, found Gates a convenient man to set up as a rival to Washington. He himself did not aspire
to be commander-in-chief, though he would have had no doubt as to his capacity. Washington knew him well. "His merit as
an officer," wrote the Commander-in-chief, "and his importance in this army exist more in his own imagination than in
reality. For it is a maxim with him to leave no service of his own untold, nor to want anything which is to be obtained
by importunity." Conway thought Gates was the rising man, and he meant to rise with him. He filled his ear with things
which he thought would please him, and among other letters wrote him one in which these words occurred: "Heaven has
determined to save your country, or a weak general and bad counselors would have ruined it."</p>

<p>Now Gates was foolish enough to show this letter to Wilkinson, one of his aids, and Wilkinson repeated it to an aid
of Lord Stirling, one of Washington's generals, and Lord Stirling at once sat down and wrote it off to Washington.
Thereupon Washington, who knew Conway too well to waste any words upon him, sat down and wrote him this letter:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">Sir,</span>&mdash;A letter which I received last night contained the following
paragraph:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"'In a letter from General Conway to General Gates he says: Heaven has determined to save your
country, or a weak general and bad counselors would have ruined it.'</p>

<p class="blockquot">"I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<span class="smcap">George Washington</span>."</p>

<p>That was all, but it was quite enough to throw Conway and Gates and Mifflin into a panic. How did Washington get hold
of the sentence? Had

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">[Pg 667]</a></span>

he seen any other letters? How much did he know? In point of fact, that was all that Washington had seen. He had a
contempt for Conway. He knew of Mifflin's hostility and that Gates was now cool to him; but he did not suspect Gates of
any intrigue, and he supposed for a while that Wilkinson's message had been intended only to warn him of Conway's evil
mind.</p>

<p>Gates was greatly perplexed to know what to do, but he finally wrote to Washington as if there were some wretch who
had been stealing letters and might be discovering the secrets of the American leaders. He begged Washington to help him
find the rascal. Washington replied, giving him the exact manner in which the letter came into his hands, and then
closed with a few sentences that showed Gates clearly that he had lost the confidence of his commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>That particular occasion passed, but presently the cabal showed its head again, this time working through Congress.
It secured the appointment of a Board of War, with Gates at the head, and a majority of the members from men who were
hostile to Washington. Now, they thought, Washington will resign, and to help matters on they spread the report that
Washington was about to resign. The general checkmated them at once by a letter to a friend, in which he wrote:</p>

<p class="blockquot">"To report a design of this kind is among the arts which those who are endeavoring to effect a
change, are practicing to bring it to pass.... While the public are satisfied with my endeavors, I mean not to shrink
from the cause. But the moment her voice, <em>not that of faction</em>, calls upon me to resign, I shall do it with as
much pleasure as ever the wearied traveler retired to rest."</p>

<p>The cabal was not yet defeated. It had failed by roundabout methods. It looked about in Congress and counted the
disaffected to see if it would be possible to get a majority vote in favor of a motion to arrest the commander-in-chief.
So at least the story runs which, from its nature, would not be found in any record, but was whispered from one man to
another. The day came when the motion was to be tried; the conspiracy leaked out, and Washington's friends bestirred
themselves. They needed one more vote. They sent post-haste for one of their number, Gouverneur Morris, who was absent
in camp; but they feared they could not get him in time. In their extremity, they went to William Duer, a member from
New York, who was dangerously ill. Duer sent for his doctor.</p>

<p>"Doctor," he asked, "can I be carried to Congress?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but at the risk of your life," replied the physician.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I should expire before reaching the place?" earnestly inquired the patient.</p>

<p>"No," came the answer; "but I would not answer for your leaving it alive."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. You have done your duty and I will do mine!" exclaimed Duer. "Prepare a litter for me; if you will
not, somebody else will, but I prefer your aid."</p>

<p>The demand was in earnest, and Duer had already started when it was announced that Morris had returned and that he
would not be needed. Morris had come direct from the camp with the latest news of what was going on there. His vote
would make it impossible for the enemies of Washington to carry their point; their opportunity was lost, and they never
recovered it.</p>

<p>It was not the end of the cabal, however. They still cherished their hostility to Washington, and they sought to
injure him where he would feel the wound most keenly. They tried to win from him the young Marquis de La Fayette, who
had come from France to join the American army, and whom Washington had taken to his heart. La Fayette was ambitious and
enthusiastic. Conway, who had been in France, did his best to attach himself to the young Frenchman, but he betrayed his
hatred of Washington, and that was enough to estrange La Fayette. Then a winter campaign in Canada was planned, and the
cabal intrigued to have La Fayette appointed to command it. It was argued that as a Frenchman he would have an influence
over the French Canadians. But the plotters hoped that, away from Washington, the young marquis could be more easily
worked upon, and it was intended that Conway should be his second in command.</p>

<p>Of course, in contriving this plan, Washington was not consulted; but the moment La Fayette was approached, he
appealed to Washington for advice. Washington saw through the device, but he at once said, "I would rather it should be
you than another." La Fayette insisted on Kalb being second in command instead of Conway, whom he disliked and
distrusted. Congress was in session at York, and thither La Fayette went to receive his orders. Gates, who spent much of
his time in the neighborhood of Congress, seeking to influence the members, was there, and La Fayette was at once
invited to join him and his friends at dinner. The talk ran freely, and great things were promised of the Canada
expedition, but not a word was said about Washington. La Fayette listened and noticed. He thought of the contrast
between the meager fare and the sacrifices at Valley Forge, and this feast at which he was a guest. He watched his
opportunity, and near the end of the dinner, he said:</p>

<p>"I have a toast to propose. There is one health, gentlemen, which we have not yet drunk. I have the honor to propose
it to you: The Commander-in-chief of the armies of the United States!"</p>

<p>It was a challenge which no one dared openly

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">[Pg 668]</a></span>

to take up, but there was an end to the good spirits of the company. La Fayette had shown his colors, and he was let
alone after that. Indeed, the Canada expedition never was undertaken, for the men who were urging it were not in earnest
about anything but diminishing the honor of Washington. It is the nature of cabals and intrigues that they flourish in
the dark. They can not bear the light. As soon as these hostile intentions began to reach the ears of the public, great
was the indignation aroused, and one after another of the conspirators made haste to disown any evil purpose. Gates and
Mifflin each publicly avowed their entire confidence in Washington, and Conway, who had fought a duel and supposed
himself to be dying, made a humble apology. The cabal melted away, leaving Washington more secure than ever in the
confidence of men&mdash;all the more secure that he did not lower himself by attempting the same arts against his
traducers. When Conway was uttering his libels behind his back, Washington was openly declaring his judgment of Conway;
and throughout the whole affair, Washington kept his hands clean, and went his way with a manly disregard of his
enemies.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIX.</h4>
<h5>MONMOUTH.</h5>

<p>The news of the French alliance, and consequent war between France and England, compelled the English to leave
Philadelphia. They had taken their ease there during the winter, while hardships and Steuben's drilling and Washington's
unflagging zeal had made the American army at Valley Forge strong and determined. A French fleet might at any time sail
up the Delaware, and with the American army in the rear, Philadelphia would be a hard place to hold. So General Howe
turned his command over to General Clinton, and went home to England, and General Clinton set about marching his army
across New Jersey to New York.</p>

<p>The moment the troops left Philadelphia, armed men sprang up all over New Jersey to contest their passage, and
Washington set his army in motion, following close upon the heels of the enemy, who were making for Staten Island. There
was a question whether they should attack the British and bring on a general engagement, or only follow them and vex
them. The generals on whom Washington most relied, Greene, La Fayette, and Wayne, all good fighters, urged that it would
be a shame to let the enemy leave New Jersey without a severe punishment. The majority of generals in the council,
however, strongly opposed the plan of giving battle. They said that the French alliance would undoubtedly put an end to
the war at once. Why, then, risk life and success? The British army, moreover, was strong and well equipped.</p>

<p>The most strenuous opponent of the fighting plan was General Charles Lee. When he was left in command of a body of
troops at the time of Washington's crossing the Hudson river more than a year before, his orders were to hold himself in
readiness to join Washington at any time. In his march across New Jersey, Washington had repeatedly sent for Lee, but
Lee had delayed in an unaccountable manner, and finally was himself surprised by a company of dragoons, and taken
captive. For a year he had been held a prisoner, and only lately had been released on exchange. He had returned to the
army while the cabal against Washington was going on, and had taken part in it, for he always felt that he ought to be
first and Washington second. He was second in command now, and his opinion had great weight. He was a trained soldier,
and besides, in his long captivity he had become well acquainted with General Clinton, and he professed to know well the
condition and temper of the British officers.</p>

<p>Washington thus found himself unsupported by a majority of his officers. But he had no doubt in his own mind that the
policy of attack was a sound one. All had agreed that it was well to harass the enemy; he therefore ordered La Fayette
with a large division to fall upon the enemy at an exposed point. He thought it not unlikely that this would bring on a
general action, and he disposed his forces so as to be ready for such an emergency. He gave the command to La Fayette,
because Lee had disapproved the plan; but after La Fayette had set out, Lee came to Washington and declared that La
Fayette's division was so large as to make it almost an independent army, and that therefore he would like to change his
mind and take command. It never would do to have his junior in such authority.</p>

<p>Here was a dilemma. Washington could not recall La Fayette. He wished to make use of Lee; so he gave Lee two
additional brigades, sent him forward to join La Fayette, when, as his senior, he would of course command the entire
force; and at the same time he notified La Fayette of what he had done, trusting to his sincere devotion to the cause in
such an emergency.</p>

<p>When Clinton found that a large force was close upon him, he took up his position at Monmouth Court House, now
Freehold, New Jersey and prepared to meet the Americans. Washington knew Clinton's movements and sent word to Lee at
once to attack the British, unless there should be very

powerful reasons to the contrary; adding that he himself was bringing up the rest of the army. Lee had joined La Fayette
and was now in command of the advance. La Fayette was eager to move upon the enemy.</p>

<p>"You do not know British soldiers," said Lee; "we can not stand against them. We shall certainly be driven back at
first, and we must be cautious."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said La Fayette. "But we have beaten British soldiers, and we can do it again."</p>

<span class="caption">WASHINGTON REBUKING LEE, AT MONMOUTH.</span>
</div>

<p>Soon after, one of Washington's aids appeared for intelligence, and La Fayette, in despair at Lee's inaction, sent
the messenger to urge Washington to come at once to the front; that he was needed. Washington was already on the way,
before the messenger reached him, when he was met by a little fifer boy, who cried out:</p>

<p>"They are all coming this way, your honor."</p>

<p>"Who are coming, my little man?" asked General Knox, who was riding by Washington.</p>

<p>"Why, our boys, your honor, our boys, and the British right after them."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Washington, and he galloped to a hill just ahead. To his amazement and dismay, he saw his men
retreating. He lost not an instant, but, putting spurs to his horse, dashed forward. After him flew the officers who had
been riding by his side, but they could not overtake him. His horse, covered with foam, shot down the road over a bridge
and up the hill beyond. The retreating column saw him come. The men knew him; they stopped; they made way for the
splendid-looking man, as he, their leader, rode headlong into the midst of them. Lee was there, ordering the retreat,
and Washington drew his rein as he came upon him. A moment of terrible silence&mdash;then Washington burst out, his eyes
flashing:</p>

<p>"What, sir, is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"Sir, sir," stammered Lee.</p>

<p>"I desire to know, sir, the meaning of this disorder and confusion?"</p>

<p>Lee, enraged now by Washington's towering passion, made an angry reply. He declared that the whole affair was against
his opinion.</p>

<p>"You are a poltroon!" flashed back Washington, with an oath. "Whatever your opinion may have been, I expected my
orders to be obeyed."</p>

<p>"These men can not face the British grenadiers," answered Lee.</p>

<p>"They can do it, and they shall!" exclaimed Washington, galloping off to survey the ground. Presently he came back;
his wrath had gone down

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">[Pg 670]</a></span>

in the presence of the peril to the army. He would waste no strength in cursing Lee.</p>

<p>"Will you retain the command here, or shall I?" he asked. "If you will, I will return to the main body and have it
formed on the next height."</p>

<p>"It is equal to me where I command," said Lee, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Then remain here," said Washington. "I expect you to take proper means for checking the enemy."</p>

<p>"Your orders shall be obeyed, and I shall not be the first to leave the ground," replied Lee, with spirit.</p>

<p>The rest of the day the battle raged, and when night came the enemy had been obliged to fall back, and Washington
determined to follow up his success in the morning. He directed all the troops to lie on their arms where they were. He
himself lay stretched on the ground beneath a tree, his cloak wrapped about him. About midnight, an officer came near
with a message, but hesitated, reluctant to waken him.</p>

<p>"Advance, sir, and deliver your message," Washington called out; "I lie here to think, and not to sleep."</p>

<p>In the morning, Washington prepared to renew the attack, but the British had slipped away under cover of the
darkness, not willing to venture another battle.</p>

<p>Pursuit, except by some cavalry, was unavailing. The men were exhausted. The sun beat down fiercely, and the hot sand
made walking difficult. Moreover, the British fleet lay off Sandy Hook, and an advance in that direction would lead the
army nearer to the enemy's re-enforcements. Accordingly Washington marched his army to Brunswick and thence to the
Hudson river, crossed it, and encamped again near White Plains.</p>

<p>After the battle of Monmouth, Lee wrote an angry letter to Washington and received a cool one in reply. Lee demanded
a court-martial, and Washington at once ordered it. Three charges were made, and Lee was convicted of disobedience of
orders in not attacking the enemy on the 28th of June, agreeably to repeated instructions; misbehavior before the enemy
on the same day, by making an unnecessary and disorderly retreat; and disrespect to the Commander-in-chief. He was
suspended from the army for a year, and he never returned to it. Long after his death, facts were brought to light which
make it seem more than probable that General Lee was so eaten up by vanity, by jealousy of Washington, and by a love of
his profession above a love of his country, that he was a traitor at heart, and that instead of being ready to sacrifice
himself for his country, he was ready to sacrifice the country to his own willful ambition and pride.</p>

<p>But his disgrace was the end of all opposition to Washington. From that time there was no question as to who was at
the head of the army and the people.</p>

<h2>THE LAST CRUISE OF "THE SLUG."</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Thomas Edwin Turner.</span></h3>

<span class="caption">C&AElig;SAR AND THE PEACOCK. (<a href="#Page_672">SEE NEXT PAGE.</a>)</span>
</div>

<p>lifford and Jack went down from Brooklyn last summer to spend a few weeks with Clifford's aunt, in the cozy old
homestead on the Shrewsbury River. Yachting was to be their chief enjoyment. To be sure, they were not practical
yachtsmen; but Jack said he "had read up the subject," and Cliff "had been out in a yacht once or twice," so they had no
fears.</p>

<p>Clifford and Jack were second cousins, and great friends; but Jack had been in the habit of spending his summers at
Saratoga, and accordingly he looked forward to his present trip with the feeling of an adventurous explorer of unknown
regions. And in order to be prepared for every emergency, he brought an "outfit" that filled a strong trunk, two
valises, a shawl-strap, and a number of queerly-shaped packages.</p>

<p>Clifford, who for several years had spent a part of each summer at his aunt's, carried a handbag. When Jack asked him
where the rest of his things were, Clifford, with a glance at his cousin's paraphernalia, answered that he preferred to
keep his "outfit" at his aunt's. He was not likely to need it elsewhere, and he saved expense for extra baggage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">[Pg 672]</a></span></p>

<p>But C&aelig;sar was Jack's chief reliance and most weighty responsibility. C&aelig;sar was a dog;&mdash;according to
Jack, a setter-dog. And as Clifford was unable to state what was the dog's breed, if it were not a setter, Jack felt
that he had established his point. Moreover, when C&aelig;sar, upon their arrival at Mud Flat, immediately celebrated
the occasion by slaughtering eight out of a brood of eleven Cochin China chicks that were great pets of their hostess,
Jack claimed that his pet's success as a game dog was assured beyond cavil. Jack was somewhat discouraged on learning
that the principal "game" in that vicinity was the sideling "shedder," or crab, and he acknowledged that in the pursuit
of such plunder he feared even C&aelig;sar was not ambitious. But nothing ever discouraged C&aelig;sar, and he had more
fun with Miss Goodmaid's favorite peacock than all the game in New Jersey would have afforded him; as subsequent events
developed the fact that he was mortally afraid of a gun. This is not strange, considering that he had spent the previous
eight months of his short life in a stable on Henry street, in Brooklyn. Indeed, his principal amusement during the rest
of the boys' visit, was to chase the gorgeous bird of Juno into the branches of a pear-tree, and stand below and
bark.</p>

<p>Though this was severe on the nervous organism of the peacock, it seemed to afford unlimited satisfaction to
C&aelig;sar, and it kept him out of so much other possible mischief, that he was rarely interfered with on these
occasions.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus694.jpg" width="400" height="367" alt="Jack Exhibits His 'Outfit.'" title="" />
<span class="caption">JACK EXHIBITS HIS "OUTFIT."</span>
</div>

<p>As soon as Jack could have his luggage taken to the house and put in the room the boys were to occupy, he hastened to
unpack his outfit before the wondering eyes of Clifford. A handsome double-barreled shot-gun, Clifford suggested, might
be used in trying to kill his aunt's three remaining chickens; a delicate split-bamboo fishing-rod might come in well
for catching live bait, if they were not in a hurry; and an extensive collection of artificial flies would perhaps serve
to frighten away the mosquitoes. A large horse-pistol Cliff thought would be "just the thing for picking off bull-frogs
in the marshes"; but he was forced to tell his cousin that he feared his shooting-coat, his fine yachting suit, his
knickerbockers for mountain

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">[Pg 673]</a></span>

climbing, and his tennis flannels, would scarcely be needed in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Poor Jack looked ruefully at his expensive "outfit," which Clifford seemed to prize so little, and then he asked his
cousin to tell him what specialties of costume and accouterments were best fitted to the Shrewsbury region. Without
answering in words, Clifford simply pointed to a closet, through the open door of which could be seen, hanging from
hooks, a broad-brimmed straw hat, a blue flannel shirt, a stout pair of trousers, and a lanyard. A large jack-knife lay
upon the shelf, and a substantial pair of high shoes stood firmly on the floor.</p>

<p>Little more was said concerning the subject that evening, but Jack went to bed in a very sober frame of mind. In the
morning, he put all his fancy toggery back into his trunk, selecting only such useful garments as Clifford suggested,
and took an early opportunity of purchasing a hat which was an exact counterpart of the one worn by his cousin.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was dangerous to mention the word "outfit" in Jack's hearing for a long time.</p>

<p>Clifford's aunt, Miss Goodmaid, was asked to tell them where they could hire a sail-boat for their proposed trip; she
had heard that Johnny Peltsman, the carriage-maker's son, in Mud Flat, had such a boat, and to him the boys went to
"negotiate."</p>

<p>Johnny Peltsman <em>did</em> have a boat, which he said he would let, if he "could get his price." The Slug, he
admitted, looked a trifle heavy, and, while under "proper conditions" she would go fast, Johnny confessed that she
couldn't sail very close to the wind. Upon payment of five dollars, he said, the boys might have the boat for two
weeks.</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Jack, eagerly. "I dare say she will suit us perfectly. Some people may like boats that sail close to
the wind. But a boat to suit me must be able to slide away from the wind, and not stay crawling around close to it!"</p>

<p>Clifford's face was a study as his partner thus aired his nautical opinions, while Johnny Peltsman greeted the remark
with open-mouthed astonishment; and when Jack concluded his observations, Johnny said earnestly:</p>

<p>"By the way, young friend, it is understood, of course, that if you sink or wreck the Slug, you must pay
damages."</p>

<p>"Certainly, if we lose the yacht, you shall be paid for it," Jack answered, feeling rather indignant at the
suggestion.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus695.jpg" width="400" height="399" alt="The Boys Engage the 'Slug.'" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE BOYS ENGAGE THE "SLUG."</span>
</div>

<p>Being directed to the place where the Slug lay, the boys hastened away to take immediate possession. Johnny stood
looking after them until they were out of sight. Then turning to enter his shop, he soliloquized:</p>

<p>"Well, that beats all! The idea of hiring a boat without seeing it, and not caring to have it to sail close to the
wind! I suppose, of course, those chaps can swim." And with an ominous shake of the head, Johnny resumed his
carriage-making.</p>

<p>Our heroes found their prize lying in a little cove just above the bridge. The Slug was a flat-bottomed center-board
boat, fifteen feet long, five feet across the stern, and narrowing gradually to a point at the bows. A more clumsy
sail-boat was never seen. But Jack only noticed the two large lockers, and with unbounded satisfaction, remarked to his
cousin:</p>

<p>"We can stow away a big stock of provisions in those boxes, Cliff."</p>

<p>It was Friday, so the two boys decided to give the "yacht" a short trial-trip down to the Highlands and back. In that
way they would become familiar with the boat, and on Monday morning would be ready to start on a week's cruise. It
chanced that a flood-tide was just beginning when the lads shoved

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">[Pg 674]</a></span>

the Slug well out into the river, while the wind was blowing a brisk gale straight down-stream, the very direction in
which the boys wished to go. Clifford was enough of a sailor to step the little mast and properly set the leg-of-mutton
sail for a breeze directly astern. With a strong wind behind her, and only a weak tide opposing, it was not surprising
that the Slug made a progress quite satisfactory to the two amateur yachtsmen. As the tide increased in force, however,
the boat went slower and slower, and it was six o'clock when the Highlands "hove in sight," as Jack said&mdash;having
learned that and other nautical terms from his story-books. On finding how late it was, Clifford remarked:</p>

<p>"We'd better be making for home."</p>

<p>The boys managed to put the Slug about, and very soon Jack ascertained that there were times when it was an advantage
to have a boat able to sail close to the wind; for, as the breeze still blew down-stream, Clifford found it simply
impossible to beat up the river in the Slug. The truth was, the only "proper conditions" under which Johnny Peltsman's
boat would sail at all were those of going straight before the wind!</p>

<span class="caption">"'HOW CAN YOU SLEEP?' ASKED CLIFFORD."</span>
</div>

<p>Clifford told Jack that they must "row the old tub back to Mud Flat," and both boys pluckily bent to the work. It was
hard work, too. The oars were long and heavy, the boat was as unwieldy as a raft of logs, and at length Jack
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Cliff, that the scenery along this river is very monotonous. We passed just such banks and houses as
those over there, ten minutes ago."</p>

<p>Clifford threw a hurried glance shoreward, looked down at the water, and immediately pulled his oar into the boat,
saying:</p>

<p>"The fates are against us, Jack. In spite of our pulling and tugging, we are actually drifting down-stream. The tide
has turned; it's dead against us, and so is the wind. It would take a Cunarder to tow this miserable scow back to Mud
Flat, now."</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" asked Jack, suddenly realizing that they might be swept out into the bay, where the whitecaps
gave evidence that a very high sea would be encountered.</p>

<p>"Neither of us can swim very far," said Clifford. "Our only chance is to land on that little island, yonder. Luckily
we're drifting straight toward it."</p>

<p>Favored by the current, the boat was carried close to the sand-bar of the island, and by a vigorous use of the oars
they were able to bring their craft safely to land.</p>

<p>"We'll have to stay here until slack water," said Clifford, "and then perhaps we can row across to the shore. The
next slack will be about midnight, so we'd better camp here and take advantage of to-morrow morning's slack. Then we can
cross to the Highlands Landing, a short distance below here, and go back by steamboat. The Seabird will tow the Slug
home for us."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll stand by you," laconically answered Jack.</p>

<p>They at once set about gathering grass and sea-weed with which to make a bed, intending to use the Slug's sail for a
covering. After a couch had been arranged to their satisfaction, the two

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">[Pg 675]</a></span>

friends strolled around their domain, which they found to be a little larger than a city lot. During their walk, the
boys caught four or five soft-shell crabs, which the epicurean Jack prudently stowed away in one of the lockers.</p>

<p>The mosquitoes had troubled the lads greatly from the moment they landed on the sand-island; and, as they had no
matches and could not make a "smudge," they soon decided to "turn in" as Jack technically stated. But then the vicious
insects attacked their victims in clouds, until the boys were forced to cover their heads and hands completely with the
sail; and in that uncomfortable condition they finally fell asleep.</p>

<p>It seemed but a short time to Clifford before he became conscious of a stinging, smarting sensation on his face that
was almost unbearable, and he awoke to find that he was literally covered with swarms of the poisonous little pests,
while Jack, snugly rolled up in the sailcloth of which he had taken complete possession in his sleep, snored loudly.</p>

<p>Slapping, brushing, and shaking off his tormentors, Clifford punched his companion and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How can you sleep through this?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>I'm</em> all right," answered Jack, in smothered tones.</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I'm</em> not!" growled Clifford, as he sprang to his feet and proceeded to spend the few hours until
daybreak in battle with his small but ferocious enemies.</p>

<p>At sunrise, the castaways refreshed themselves with a prolonged bath; and then, hungry as bears, they impatiently
waited for slack water, when they sprang into the Slug, and by long and hard work, at last reached the mainland not far
above the Highlands.</p>

<span class="caption">"THE TWO HUNGRY LADS WERE SOON DISPATCHING THEIR BREAKFAST."</span>
</div>

<p>An investigation of their finances showed the boys that they had, together, exactly sixty-five cents. With that sum,
therefore, they had to provide a breakfast, pay steamboat fares home, and meet unknown incidental expenses. A little
shop was soon found where coffee, butter, and a roll would be furnished to each boy for thirty cents. Their fares home
would amount to twenty cents; and the boys decided to take the chance that fifteen cents would prove adequate to the
unforeseen. Remembering the soft-shell crabs in the locker, Clifford induced the good-natured landlady to cook them
"without extra charge;" and soon the two hungry lads were dispatching their thirty-cent breakfast, which included fried
potatoes, also "donated" by the kind-hearted hostess.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock on that eventful Saturday morning, the young navigators re-embarked and dropped down with the tide to
the steamboat landing at the Highlands.</p>

<p>The boys soon saw the Seabird plowing her way to the landing. When she had landed, the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">[Pg 676]</a></span>

Slug was quickly made fast to the stern of the larger boat, and ere long the steamer was bearing them homeward.</p>

<p>Seated well forward on the upper deck, the boys were congratulating themselves on being at last free from all
anxiety, when suddenly they were startled by loud cries from the stern of the steamboat:</p>

<p>"Hi! Hi! You lads who own the little boat astern! Hurry! quick! quick! She's sinking! she's sinking!"</p>

<p>Running to the spot whence came those warning shouts; Clifford and Jack looked down at the Slug and saw that the
small center-board had been thrown entirely out of its trunk by the force of the water which had been churned to a white
foam under the huge paddle-wheels of the Seabird,&mdash;and a broad stream pouring through this opening into their
"yacht" threatened each moment to swamp it.</p>

<p>"Bother that yacht! She's going to haunt us all our lives!" cried Jack, in dismay; but Clifford, taking in the state
of affairs at a glance, ran to the lower deck, and with one stroke of his pocket-knife cut the Slug's painter, and then
the two boys silently and sadly watched their boat drop far behind in the fan-shaped wake of the larger vessel.</p>

<p>"She may be picked up by some one alongshore, but, more likely, she'll go to the bottom," thoughtfully remarked
Clifford.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Jack; "that yacht will never sink! She will be turning up against us all through life,
bringing trouble and disgrace."</p>

<p>In due time, the boys arrived at the Goodmaid homestead, where they received a warm welcome from Clifford's aunt, who
had almost begun to fear that her young guests were at the bottom of the Shrewsbury.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, bright and early, the two boys started down the left bank of the river to find their boat. They
found it after an hour's walk. It had been hauled out upon the beach. The Slug had been sighted and recovered by a
farmer living alongshore. After paying two dollars as salvage, Jack asked the farmer concerning the best way of getting
the boat home.</p>

<p>"There are three ways," answered the man, thoughtfully. "The first is to wait till there's a hurricane blowing
straight up the river, when perhaps you can sail up. The second is to hire me to row her up. And the third is to let me
put the boat on my lumber wagon, and haul it up to Mud Flat."</p>

<p>"Of the three, which would be best?" persisted Jack.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the farmer, "you may have to wait weeks for the hurricane; I will haul the boat for two dollars; and
I will undertake to row it up the river&mdash;(though, understand, I don't say how long I shall be about it)&mdash;but
row her up I will, somehow, and charge you only two hundred and fifty dollars for the job. And that's very cheap, I can
tell you, for I know that boat!"</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that the boys decided that the Slug should go home on wheels, provided they might ride,
too, without increase of pay. By the use of rollers, an inclined plane and levers, the boat was safely hoisted upon the
wagon. The farmer occupied the bow, and Jack and Cliff each sat on a thwart.</p>

<p>And now, for the first time in her history, the Slug was under complete control. The whip cracked, the horses
strained at their collars, the wheels rolled, and away went Jack's "yacht," trundling homeward. The road led past the
Goodmaid farm, and over the long bridge crossing the Shrewsbury. As they neared the farm, the boys raised a shout, and
C&aelig;sar, Jack's mongrel and mischievous dog, leaving the peacock for a moment, came bounding out to meet them.</p>

<p>True to his nature, he at once began a series of noisy gambols about the farmer's young and high-spirited horses. But
soon wearying of that harmless jumping at the wagon, the dog suddenly ran under the forward wheels, and sprang at the
long fetlocks of the "near" horse.</p>

<p>Like a flash, the team made a wild plunge, and dashed down the road. The wagon was jerked from beneath the Slug, and
the boat and its passengers fell heavily to the ground. The anchor, dropping between the wagon-box and a wheel, became
firmly fixed; while the line to which the anchor was attached, being good manilla rope, was uncoiled and dragged after
the horses with great rapidity.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the boys and the driver had time to jump out of the "yacht" before the anchor-rope was all "paid out,"
and so, with the exception of a bad shaking-up and a few bruises, they suffered no injury from their unceremonious
disembarking. But the sudden fall had "broken the backbone" of the Slug, as Jack expressed it; and, as if that were not
enough, the poor boat, as it hung by the painter, was swung, bumped, knocked, and dragged along, until it was literally
reduced to fragments. There was scarcely a residence in all Mud Flat that did not have, long afterward, some
satisfactory reminder of the last cruise of the Slug.</p>

<p>But all agreed that the old boat had one virtue&mdash;it made famous firewood!</p>

<h2>WONDERS OF THE ALPHABET.</h2>

<p>In tracing back our letters, we now have reached Chalkis, where the Ph&oelig;nicians under Kadmus taught the Greeks
their letters. A funny thing occurred to the wise men who ferreted out all these facts. They could read Greek, and they
could read Hebrew, and the strange likeness between many of the names for the letters in the two languages made it
certain that in some way they were related or connected. But what meant those letters on rocks, metal vases, and
earthenware jars that we now call Ph&oelig;nician? Single letters looked like Greek letters distorted; but the words
would not read as Greek. Nor would they read as Hebrew, although the characters appeared to have some connection with
Hebrew. Greek is written like our writing, from left to right; but Hebrew, Arabic, and Persian are written from right to
left. So, in those languages a book begins where our books end. It was found, too, that the Hebrew writing now in use is
very different externally from that used by David and Solomon, although the names and general shape of the letters are
the same. Have you ever seen a Hebrew Bible? The alphabet in which the Old Testament was originally written looked very
different from that which the Jews now use in their Bibles; it was much nearer the Ph&oelig;nician in appearance.</p>

<p>For a long time it never dawned on men's minds that perhaps the Ph&oelig;nician way of writing, from right to left,
was not followed by the Greeks; but at last they remembered that in very early times the lines of Greek writing were
made to read alternately from right to left and from left to right. Such inscriptions were called
<em>boustreph&eacute;don</em> ("turning like oxen in plowing"), because the letters had to be read as the oxen move from
furrow to furrow in the field that they plow, first one way, then the other. That gave the needed clew.</p>

<p>After all, if we do not connect letters one to the other, as in running handwriting, does it make much difference
whether we set the separate letters down in a sequence which begins at the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">[Pg 678]</a></span>

right and ends at the left, or in one that begins at the left and ends at the right? Some nations, like the Chinese and
Tartars, find it convenient to write signs <em>under</em> each other. The Egyptians used to write in at least three
several directions, namely, downwards, from right to left, and from left to right. Generally one can tell how to read
hieroglyphs in Egyptian and Mexican manuscripts by noting the direction of the faces of animals and persons pictured,
and then reading in the opposite direction. Sometimes Egyptian hieroglyphs were engraved one upon the other, like a
monogram.</p>

<p>Well, putting some or all of these facts together, it suddenly flashed on some one that the oldest Greek letters
might be nothing more or less than the Ph&oelig;nician letters turned the other way. And when they came to examine the
very oldest Greek inscriptions to be found, they discovered that this was the main difference between the two! The
Greeks had borrowed the Ph&oelig;nician letters and merely added some new characters to express sounds peculiar to their
own tongue and neglected others that were of no service.</p>

<p>It was this alphabet that the Greek-Ph&oelig;nicians brought to Italy. When, centuries later, Latins and Sabines and
Etruscans and Oscans, banded together and formed the great city of Rome, it was this alphabet they inherited from their
forefathers. Several of the letters which the Etruscans thought necessary to express sounds in their language, were
dropped before the Romans came to power and produced their great poets and essayists.</p>

<p>So, now you know how the alphabet came to you, which the Irish monks taught our heathen forefathers. It came through
the Latins from the people of B&oelig;otia, or Greeks, who learned it from the Ph&oelig;nicians.</p>

<p>But that great mercantile people, the Ph&oelig;nicians, also left to the nations near their old home in Palestine,
the same precious gift of an alphabet. Very old inscriptions in Hebrew, lately found, are seen to be written in almost
the same alphabet as the Ph&oelig;nician. Perhaps you are beginning to wonder how many peoples there are who owe their
letters to that old sea-folk who were the traders, pirates, and buccaneers of the Mediterranean! There is the Hebrew,
which people have called the alphabet of God, because the Holy Scriptures were written in it, and which was also used by
magicians for their amulets and talismans; there is the Greek, in which the epics of Homer, the long poems of Hesiod,
and the rhapsodies of Pindar were taken down; there is the Latin, in which all the wisdom of the ancients reached us;
and there are all the differing alphabets, printed characters, and script handwritings of Europe and America! In fact, I
could not tell you here, so numerous are they, the names of all the languages in Asia, Africa, Europe, and America, that
were and are written in some alphabet, which traces its descent from the twenty-two Ph&oelig;nician letters.</p>

<p>The connection between Greek and Ph&oelig;nician is much easier to believe than that Arabic, a sentence of which you
see here represented, should be also a writing derived from the Ph&oelig;nician. Arabic letters are used by so large a
portion of the inhabitants of the earth that it stands second among the great national, or rather, the great religious
alphabets of the world. Some of you know, I suppose, that Mohammed was a very wise and imaginative Arab of an important
though poor tribe of Arabia Felix. He was a great poet and statesman; he had visions and called himself the Prophet of
God. He wrote the Koran, which is used by an immense multitude of men as their only law-book and Bible. The dialect
which he and his clan used became, through the spread of his doctrines, the standard, first for all Arabia, and then for
all the enormous countries a hundred times larger than Arabia which his disciples and their followers won by force of
arms.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 800px;">
<img src="images/illus703.png" width="800" height="105" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">This Arabic sentence is a famous inscription upon the colonnade of one of the great mosques at Jerusalem. The mosque is known as the "Dome of the Rock," and it is thought to stand upon a portion of the site of the
great Jewish Temple. This inscription is placed near the great southern door of the mosque. It is in one continuous
line, however, instead of two as represented in this fac-simile. It reads from right to left, and is thus translated:
"This dome was built by the servant of God, Abd [allah-el-Imam-al-Mam&ucirc;n, E] mir of the Faithful, in the year
seventy-two. May God be well pleased, and be satisfied with him. Amen."</span>
</div>

<p>Of course the alphabet he used did not spring up suddenly. It was handed down from the early times of the
Ph&oelig;nicians, and gradually became so changed in most of the letters that you would hardly believe they had ever
been the same as the Ph&oelig;nician letters. Writers of it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">[Pg 679]</a></span>

were so careless, or so proud of being able to read and write when the mass of their neighbors were ignorant, that,
neglectfully or intentionally, they allowed many letters to become almost like one another. In the Arabic, Turkish, and
Persian languages, it is hard to tell a number of the letters apart. In order to distinguish them, later writers devised
a set of dots, like the dot over our small i. The same difficulty occurred among the Hebrews, whose wise men seemed to
enjoy making writing hard to write and to read. Another reason why Arabic is hard to make out is because many of the
letters change their forms according as they stand alone (unconnected), or stand at the beginning of a word (initial),
or in between two other letters (connected) or at the end of a word (final). Think of having to distinguish the same
letter under four different forms! What a bother to the children of the Arabs, Turks, and Persians as they sit
tailor-fashion, or kneel patiently on the floor, their shoes left outside the threshold, while the school-master
flourishes his rod over their puzzled noddles, or raps the soles of their tired little feet!</p>

<p>Now Arabic letters and Hebrew, too, if you try to trace them back to Ph&oelig;nician, are found to have passed
through the hands of a people who occupied the high lands of Asia Minor, where the two great "rivers of Babylon," the
Euphrates and the Tigris, begin to run their course. This land was called Aram and the ancient language spoken there,
the Aramaic. Between Ph&oelig;nician and Aramaic the connection is close. The Aramaic took the place of the
Ph&oelig;nician language, when the Ph&oelig;nicians were edged out of Palestine westward over the Mediterranean. So we
see that Arabic, which looks so strange and is so elegant and fantastic when embroidered on banners or traced on tiles
or written on the beautiful mulberry-leaf paper of the Orient, really uses, in the main, the same alphabet that looks so
plain and simple on the page you are reading!</p>

<span class="caption">PERSIAN SENTENCE.</span>
</div>

<p>Both Ph&oelig;nician and Aramaic were in all probability spoken and written in Palestine and Aram. It was in Aramaic,
too, that the words of Christ and his apostles were spoken; and a few of the actual words are still retained in the New
Testament, for example "Talitha cumi," meaning "Maid, arise!" It was probably Aramaic that prevailed also in the great
capitals of Mesopotamia, while the rich and haughty kings of Babylonia and Assyria were using on their stone and plaster
images and in their queer books of inscribed and baked brick, the writing that is called "cuneiform." It is so called
because the letters appear to to be formed of little <em>cunei</em>, wedges, or nails. "Arrow-headed writing" is another
name for it. Look well at this curious writing made by engraving on brick. Several different languages have been written
in it.</p>

<h2>WILD HUNTERS.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By John R. Coryell.</span></h3>

<p>Everybody knows the old story of the father who taught his sons to be united by showing them a bundle of sticks.
Taken together, the sticks could not be broken; but taken singly, they were snapped in two very quickly.</p>

<p>The wild dogs of South Africa, like the bundle of sticks, furnish an example of the value of unity. A single wild dog
is not very formidable, but a pack of wild dogs is the dread of every living creature in the part of Africa where they
dwell; and more persevering, savage, and relentless hunters do not exist.</p>

<p>The wild dog has keen scent, quick intelligence, great powers of endurance, and great speed; so that, however swift
may be the animal pursued, it has cause to fear this tireless hunter. Indeed, the wild dog never seems to take into
consideration the size, strength, or agility of its game. Even the lion, it is said, has learned to dread those small
hunters, which seem to have no fear of death, but rush with fierce courage to attack the mighty monarch himself, should
he be so unlucky as to become the object of their pursuit.</p>

<p>One traveler tells of having witnessed the pursuit and destruction of a large leopard by a pack of wild dogs. Whether
or not the dogs had set out with the intention of capturing the leopard, he could not tell. He saw them start up the
great cat in a low jungle. The leopard made no effort at first to fight off its assailants; but, with a series of
prodigious springs, sought shelter in the only refuge the plain afforded&mdash;a tree which had partially fallen.</p>

<p>There the hunted beast stood, snarling and growling in a manner that would have frightened off any ordinary foe. The
savage dogs, however, never hesitated a moment, but with agile leaps ran up the sloping trunk, and gave instant battle
to their furious game. One after another, the dogs were hurled back, each stroke of the terrible paw making one foe the
less. Yet they continued to throw themselves against the enraged creature, until, wearied by the contest and wounded in
fifty places, it fell from the tree; when, still struggling, it was quickly torn to pieces.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the wild dog usually prefers as formidable game as the leopard. A sheep-fold
is always an attraction too great for the wild dog to pass.</p>

<p>And now, after calling this wild hunter a dog, I shall have to say that it is not a dog at all, but is only a sort of
cousin to the dog, and really a nearer relative of the hyena, though it so resembles both animals as to have gained the
name of hyena-dog. Its scientific name is <em>Lycaon venaticus</em>; and besides the two common names already mentioned,
it has half a dozen more.</p>

<p>Being neither dog nor hyena, and yet akin to both, it is one of those strange forms of the animal creation which
naturalists call "links." It has four toes, like the hyena, while it has teeth like the dog's.</p>

<p>Some attempts have been made to tame it, so as to gain the use of its wonderful powers of hunting; but none of these
efforts have yet been successful, because of the suspicious nature of the animal. It seems to feel that every offer of
kindness or familiarity is a menace to its liberty.</p>

<h2>NAN'S REVOLT.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Rose Lattimore Alling.</span></h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter I.</span></h4>

<p>There was a gentlemanly raising of hats and a womanly fluttering of skirts at the Ferrises' door. The hats were borne
down the dark avenue, and could be seen, occasionally, swinging briskly along under the light of successive lampposts.
They were very stylish hats.</p>

<p>The skirts made a soft scurrying sound as they rustled upstairs, and along the dim hall, disappearing into the rooms
of their owners. They were very dainty skirts.</p>

<p>Nan closed her door, turned up the gas, stood a moment pouting at herself in the glass, pulled the wilted roses from
her belt with an impatient jerk, tossed her pretty evening dress across a chair, exchanged her boots for a pair of
slippers, and stole noiselessly into Evelyn's room to talk over the party with that dear sister and Cathy, who was
staying with them, as a guest.</p>

<p>She found those two persons waiting for her, while they straightened out the fingers of their long gloves.</p>

<p>"Well, girls," began Nan, seating herself lazily upon the middle of the bed, "there is just one solitary comfort left
after an utterly stupid evening like this: you can express your feelings to your dearest friends, and here I am to
express!"</p>

<p>"Go on, then," sighed her sister, ruefully examining a stain on her fan; "but don't speak too loud or you will waken
the household."</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be afraid, Evelyn; I'm not in one of my fire-cracker moods. No, I'm cool; I have the calmness of
stern resolve; I speak from that tranquil height which lies beyond emotion!" declaimed Nan, pulling out the hairpins
from her artistic coils.</p>

<p>"What notion have you in your busy head now? Hasten to divulge, for it is very late," suggested Cathy.</p>

<p>"Late! who cares? I shall save years of sleep by wasting this midnight's gas!" and Nan showed a gleam of fire in her
eye as she gave the pillow a vindictive thump.</p>

<p>"Well," yawned Cathy, "proceed at once"; and forthwith the audience curled itself up on the lounge, regarding the
speaker with expectant amusement, while she, after finishing off an intricate pattern in hairpins, thus began:</p>

<p>"Ahem&mdash;ladies&mdash;the subject of society in general and parties in particular, ladies and gentlemen," waving
her hand toward sundry photographs standing about on Evelyn's writing-desk, "has been under consideration for some time.
<em>Ergo</em>, <em>I</em> don't go to another one! So there! That's settled. From this time forth I shall proceed to
enjoy life in a rational way."</p>

<p>With this conclusion to her rapid speech, she scattered her design over the bedspread with one destructive finger,
and flashed upon her hearers two bright, snapping eyes, showing that she was in earnest, despite her nonsense.</p>

<p>Cathy gasped, while Evelyn exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Why, Nan, what happened? Didn't you have a gay time?"</p>

<p>This remark set Nan off, like a match to powder.</p>

<p>"<em>Gay?</em> Oh, bewilderingly, intensely gay! Yes, it was just that&mdash;'gay,' and nothing more. The party was
all right, indeed better than most, from a high moral point of view, for my hair staid in curl and my gloves didn't
burst; I danced with the most stylish goose in the room; I ate an ice with conceited Tom Lefferts in the conservatory; I
opened and shut my fan and smiled and raised my eyebrows the requisite number of times to produce the effect of having a
delightful time! Oh&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
	<p>'I would not pass another such an eve, Though 't were to buy a world of happy days.'"</p>
</div>

<p>This vivid speech was uttered in irony so cold that it would have been quite thrilling if Nan hadn't given the pillow
another vehement poke in the middle, which made its four corners swell up in stiff remonstrance.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Cathy, with a laugh, "what in the world are you going to do about it, Nan? There is a full
supply of nonsense in the world, I admit, but we can't reform the feature of the time, and we must have some
fun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Fun!</em>" interrupted Nan hotly. "Who is objecting to fun? Who loves fun better than I? But who has fun at these
shows? Did you have a really happy time to-night, Cathy? Own up now. You know that, when the flutter is over, you can't
remember one single thing worth remembering. Does it pay?"</p>

<p>"But we can't help it. What are you going to do&mdash;turn blue-stocking or prig, Nannie, love?" mildly inquired
Evelyn.</p>

<p>"'Prig'&mdash;'blue-stocking'&mdash;no, I hate the very words," said Nan, adding, "I'm seeking just what you are; the
only difference is, <em>I'm</em> going to get it and you are not. But go on, sweet children,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">[Pg 683]</a></span>

go on giving your hair extra frizzlings, go on smiling divinely at vapid nothings, and eating numberless plates of
cream&mdash;it is a noble future to contemplate! But let me tell you, deluded creatures, that you will drag home just so
many times neither benefited nor amused, and the last state of all such will be worse than the first. Let us weep!"</p>

<span class="caption">THE GIRLS DISCUSS THE PARTY.</span>
</div>

<p>And now the poor pillow went flying off upon the floor, while Nan laughed at her own peroration.</p>

<p>Her spell-bound hearers gave two gigantic sighs, while Cathy seized a cologne-bottle to restore Evelyn, who reclined
tragically upon the lounge, feigning to be completely overcome.</p>

<p>After they had succeeded in controlling their emotions, Cathy said in a wailing voice:</p>

<p>"Yes, Nan, I have a realizing sense that you are more than half right; for I do believe that, when, after such an
evening, I survey my giddy self in the glass, I sigh more often than I smile."</p>

<p>Nan, who was venting her yet unspent spite in braiding her hair into tight little curls, gave her head an emphatic
nod and declared her fell intention of finding

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">[Pg 684]</a></span>

some way out of her slough of despond. Then as the last braid dwindled to three hairs, she descended from the platform,
and thus concluded:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, thanking you for your kind attention, I beg leave to announce that there will be another
solemn conclave in regard to this vital subject, on the side veranda, to-morrow morning at ten o'clock. Good-night, you
dear old things, you are nearly asleep, and I've wearied you more than did that wretched party. Why, no! Cathy's eyes
are wide open! Mercy on us, Cathy thinks she's thinking! Go on, dear, it wont harm you at all."</p>

<span class="caption">"NAN LAY IN THE HAMMOCK THINKING."</span>
</div>

<p>With this parting fling, she hopped to the door, holding in her hand one slipper, which she waved tragically,
exclaiming, "Farewell, base world!" and was gone.</p>

<p>"What a girl she is!" said Evelyn, as the audience unbent itself. "She didn't give me a chance to agree with or to
combat her theories; but, do you know, I am tired of it, too, just as much as Nan is, only she has vigor enough to rebel
at the thraldom of her bright, natural self, while I keep on and on from mere inertia."</p>

<p>"Well," said Cathy, slowly winding her watch, "I <em>was</em> thinking, as Nan said&mdash;but it is one o'clock, and
I shall not say another word until to-morrow."</p>

<hr style="width:25%" />

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span></h4>

<p>The bell in St. Luke's steeple rang out the stroke for three-quarters after nine in the morning. Nan lay in the
hammock, gazing up through the woodbine of the before-mentioned side veranda. The leaves were beginning to turn maroon
and russet; but evidently she was not looking at these, for her pretty eyes were taking in a wider angle of light. In
truth, there was a deep little wrinkle between her eyebrows, which implied deep thought.</p>

<p>However, as the bell began on its ten strokes, she withdrew her stare from the far, unseen horizon, rolled out of the
hammock, came down hard on her two trim boots, stood up straight, and gazed the landscape o'er.</p>

<p>"Not a girl in sight," she said to herself, with an amused laugh; "I believe the silly things are afraid of me; maybe
they think I have become one of those reformers&mdash;oh me, how shy girls are of a <em>cause</em>! Well, anyhow, I have
one, or rather a <em>be</em>cause, and they must give me a fair hearing, though I must be wiser than a whole collection
of serpents." She had reflected thus far, when she espied a blue eye peeping around the corner of the bay-window.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cathy!" she shouted; "oh, you perfidious foe! Come here! Where are the girls?"</p>

<p>Cathy brought the companion eye into view, and finally two other pairs appeared, accompanied by their respective
owners, Evelyn carrying

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">[Pg 685]</a></span>

a basket of grapes. How merry they were, and how they laughed in that contagious girl-fashion as they encamped about
Nan! They made a group charming to behold, and they seemed capable of tossing anybody's blues away as easily as they now
threw grape-skins into the sunny air. But they were not remarkable in any respect; they had their full share of graces
and defects, of assorted sizes, both of feature and character. No one of them was in the least a heroine; but the group
was very like any other group that might have been found in many neighborhoods, on that pleasant September morning.</p>

<p>Bert Mitchell, who was the only addition to the party of the night before, ensconced herself in the hammock with
Cathy Drake. The two girls differed from each other in many respects, but were great friends, as is often the case.</p>

<p>Bert, who was never called Bertha, as she declared in extravagant phrase that she "perfectly loathed the name," was
tall and cheery, with fine eyes, a mass of brown hair, and a voice a trifle loud. But the girls forgave her that; and
whenever she began to speak, they would always listen, assured of hearing something bright. But her most characteristic
feature was her hands. They were white and shapely, but she had a curious way of carrying them&mdash;as though she had
just put them on for the first time, and was trying different effects with them. The girls laughingly cried, "Long may
they wave!" and liked her all the same. She had an abundance of settled convictions on every possible
subject,&mdash;"positive opinions hot at all hours," Cathy's brother Fred said of her,&mdash;and she was therefore
always in a definite mood, and very good company.</p>

<p>If, as some say, beauty is tested by the ability to wear one's hair combed straight back without being a scarecrow,
Cathy, of all the girls, came nearest to being pretty, for she, and she alone, enjoyed the luxury of an even temper
during high winds, damp days, and a vacation at the seashore. Her forehead was broad and calm, her eyes were blue and
calm, and her mouth was sweet and calm. She was not positive about anything, which greatly irritated her friend Bert,
who, indeed, flew into a comical passion one day, over her failure to arouse Cathy. Shaking her, she exclaimed, "Will
nothing on earth move you! <em>Do</em> get angry&mdash;at something or some one!&mdash;at me!&mdash;at anything! Haven't
you any depths in you? If you have, stir them up!"</p>

<p>Cathy raised her crescent brows, and a faint color crept into her smooth cheek as she quietly said: "Depths don't
stir, my dear; and if stirred from the top, they are apt only to get muddy, you know. However, I'd like to accommodate
you by getting furiously angry&mdash;at you, for instance; this is an inviting opportunity, and I don't know that I
ought to miss it&mdash;but somehow it doesn't seem worth while." And even the obstreperous Bert was silenced by this
covert thrust.</p>

<p>When they all had settled themselves into various cozy attitudes, Bert demanded to know the object of the caucus. "I
hope it is something interesting, for nothing but a command from you would have induced me to crawl out this morning,"
she yawned, as she adjusted a sofa-pillow for her comfort.</p>

<p>Cathy murmured, "Hear! Hear!" but was evidently more absorbed in Evelyn's explanation of a new Kensington stitch.</p>

<p>Nan rapped sharply with the handle of a tennis racquet, and requested order. Then she gave a little cough, tossed the
grape-vine over her shoulder, and began:</p>

<p>"Fellow-citizens! I come before you on this auspicious occasion to declare treason&mdash;treason to the tyrant
commonly called 'polite society.' I've come to the solemn conclusion that it is about time I began to prepare to
live."</p>

<p>She was at this point interrupted by a groan, and Bert asked:</p>

<p>"Why, aren't you alive, Nan? I am. Life so far is a great success, and it is all your own fault if you don't think so
too. You have all the conveniences for having an uncommonly favored existence, if you only <em>insisted</em> on thinking
so."</p>

<p>But Nan retorted: "That's just it&mdash;<em>if</em> one could only think so! Aye, there's the rub. This is the place
for tears. Oh, dear!&mdash;I can't whip my thoughts into obedience to my will as you can, Bert. I have, as you say, all
the so-called 'opportunities' for having a so-called 'fine time,' and when I am old and gray, no one can say that I did
not improve them with unflagging diligence. But I don't really enjoy myself, and I don't believe you do
either&mdash;only you'll never own to it. Now, girls, honor bright, do you honestly think we amount to much? Are we
getting the most out of life?"</p>

<p>The impressiveness of the moment was ruined by the arrival of a green grape, plump upon the speaker's nose.</p>

<p>Nan was good-natured enough to laugh with the rest, as she gave it a well-directed aim back at Bert.</p>

<p>At this point Evelyn rescued the meeting from total disorder, by boldly announcing: "Stay, girls! I agree with Nan,
so far as I know what she means. Oh, she was sublime last night! I wilted under the heat of her eloquence, and I
proclaim myself her humble follower."</p>

<p>At this encouragement, Nan administered a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">[Pg 686]</a></span>

smothering hug to her noble champion; but suddenly she seemed to change her tactics from harangue to intrigue, for,
helping herself to a bunch of Dianas, she said languidly:</p>

<p>"Well, the curbed lion of my spirit was rampant last night, for I had a very inane time at that party&mdash;or
perhaps I ate too much of the lemon streak of my Neapolitan ice; at all events, I was rash enough to declare war to the
knife on all inducements from the giddy world again."</p>

<p>"But you will go to the next party as usual," interrupted Bert, as she left the hammock. "You will go every time, my
dear; you can't help it; it is inevitable fate; so you'd better calm down and meditate on your next gown."</p>

<p>"Ah, Bert! You've said it now!" almost shouted Nan. "<em>That's</em> the very point! Is it 'inevitable fate' that we
go on and on? I want something more worth the while. Do be patient with me, and let me lay the case before you as it
looks to me. Here we are, every last girl of us out of school, and doing absolutely nothing. What would we think of
young men who dawdled about at this rate, contenting themselves with a little dusting, arranging a few flowers, doing a
bit of embroidery now and then, and in <em>very</em> energetic moments painting a teacup, but chiefly being 'in
society,' and not earning one square inch even of their manly clothing? Horrors! I wouldn't recognize such a ninny!"</p>

<p>The silenced audience looked sufficiently awe-struck to encourage Nan to continue.</p>

<p>"Now, are we one whit more to be envied, just because we are girls? Wake up, Bert! And now that I'm awake myself, I
think I shall actually blush the next time Father pays me my allowance."</p>

<p>"Well, girls, Nan is in earnest," said Evelyn. "Cathy and I were almost set to thinking by her burning eloquence last
night&mdash;and I can assure you she has a scheme on foot; so, as a humble champion, I request an expression from the
meeting, upon certain points. Firstly, all who agree that the present state of things isn't very satisfying, will please
manifest it by holding up the right hand."</p>

<p>Cathy's gold thimble gleamed in the air. Bert was ostensibly asleep, with her head against the pillar, but suddenly
she sat erect, and said with great decision:</p>

<p>"I think that you are running your precious heads against a wall&mdash;and, I assure you, the wall doesn't mind it in
the least. You are in the world, and you would better treat it politely or you will get roundly snubbed in return. As
for me, I <em>must</em> meet people. Until Nan or some other philosopher offers something enticing, <em>I</em> remain
true to the ship."</p>

<p>"But suppose we do offer something in its place," said Evelyn, who had rolled up her work and stuck her needle
through it, as though she were fastening an idea within.</p>

<p>"You are not much of a sinner, so entice away," said Bert, smilingly, folding her hands.</p>

<p>"Well," Evelyn proceeded with a comical drawl, "let's be a club&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm clubbed black and blue now!" gasped Bert; "do try again, sweet child!"</p>

<p>"Let's be a club," Evelyn repeated severely, "and let us read, or study, or work, with all the might that is in
us."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the clouds had been clearing from Nan's brow, and now she called out delightedly:</p>

<p>"You are getting 'warm', as we used to say when we played 'hunt the thimble'; you are certainly traveling toward
milder climes, Evelyn. Yes, let us do something in earnest&mdash;and I know what I'm going to do, too!'</p>

<p>"What? what?" sounded in chorus.</p>

<p>"I'm going&mdash;to&mdash;earn&mdash;my&mdash;own&mdash;living."</p>

<p>At each emphatic word, Nan bobbed her head in the most decisive manner. "I'm going to seek my fortune, and I'm going
to try to lead a genuine existence."</p>

<p>The girls sat stunned, with wide open eyes, till Bert suddenly pounded on the floor with heavy applause, and Evelyn
asked breathlessly:</p>

<p>"Why, Nan, has Father failed, or lost anything?"</p>

<p>"No, <em>he</em> hasn't," answered Nan grimly, "but I have. What have I ever done since I was graduated but drift
about, vainly trying to amuse myself. Why, girls, we have <em>futures</em> before us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, not <em>before</em> us?" laughed Bert with mock incredulity.</p>

<p>But Nan, undisturbed by Bert's interruption, went calmly on:</p>

<p>"Do we wish to belong to that class of helpless women who are aghast and powerless if misfortune overtakes them? Do
we wish to depend on others all our lives&mdash;even if we have a fair prospect of property of our own" (looking hard at
Bert). "Remember that the wheel of Fortune turns once in most lives, and <em>I</em> shouldn't like to be flattened under
it!"</p>

<p>The attention of her hearers was suddenly startled by an exclamation from Bert, who stood up, with both hands at her
heart, in apparent agony. Recovering, however, with astonishing alacrity, she murmured: "Oh, it is nothing&mdash;nothing
but a barbed arrow driven home."</p>

<p>And with this mysterious remark, she settled her hat, declared it was dinner-time, and, refusing to explain her
unwonted reserve, laughingly tore herself away.</p>

<h2>THE KELP-GATHERERS.</h2>
<h4>[<em>A Story of the Maine Coast.</em>]</h4>
<h3><span class="smcap">By J. T. Trowbridge.</span></h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter VI.</span></h4>
<h5>CAMPING ON THE BEACH.</h5>

<p>The kelp-gatherers, with their tip-cart and ox-team, had in the meanwhile entered the belt of woods which stretched
along the coast, back from the sea. Tall trees rose on both sides of the narrow, sandy road, their tops meeting
overhead. There was on the outskirts a scanty undergrowth, which, however, soon disappeared, leaving the open aisles of
the forest, with here a brown carpet of pine-needles, and there a patch of bright moss.</p>

<p>The sun was going down. The spots and flickers of wine-colored light vanished from the boughs. The long bars of
shadow, cast by the great trunks, became merged in one universal shade, and evening shut down upon the woods.</p>

<p>Soon another sound mingled with that of the wind sweeping through the pines and firs. It was the roar of the sea.</p>

<p>The boys were more quiet now, the solemn scene filling their hearts with quiet joy. The large trees soon gave place
to a smaller and thicker growth of spruce and balsam, the boughs of which now and then touched the cart-wheels as they
passed. Somewhere in the dim wilderness, a thrush piped his evening song.</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Perce. "I heard something besides a bird. Is somebody calling?"</p>

<p>"A loon," said Moke.</p>

<p>"A loon out on the water," said Poke. "The sea is just off here."</p>

<p>They soon had glimpses of it through openings among the trees. But now the sound of it became louder; the woods, too,
moaned like another sea in the wind, and the cries were no longer heard.</p>

<p>They came out upon a spot of low grassy ground behind the sand-hills. There was a fresh-water pool near by. Perce
thought it a good place for the oxen; and he turned them out on the road-side. Mrs. Murcher's boarding-house was in
sight.</p>

<p>"Suppose I run up there and find Olly before it gets any darker," said Perce. "You can be

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">[Pg 688]</a></span>

unhitching the steers from the cart, and getting 'em around in a good place to feed. Fasten 'em to the cart-wheel by
this rope; tie it in the ring of the yoke. Let 'em drink first."</p>

<p>"All right," said the twins. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>And off Perce ran to summon his friend to their festivities.</p>

<p>The twins turned the cattle into the grass, and then began to make things ready for their camp and supper; keeping up
all the time an incessant dialogue, which prevented them from hearing again the cries of the supposed loon, growing
fainter and fainter on the distant waves.</p>

<p>Neither did Perce hear them as he hastened along the path in the gloomy hollow, and mounted the piazza steps. In the
hall-door of the boarding-house, he was met by a tall girl of seventeen, with a fine brunette complexion, piercing dark
eyes, and a high, thin, Roman nose.</p>

<p>Overawed a little by her rather imposing style of dress and features, Perce took off his cap, and begging her pardon,
inquired for Oliver Burdeen.</p>

<p>"Burdeen? Oliver?" she queried. "Oh!" with a pleasant smile, "you mean Olly!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "We all call him Olly where he lives, but I wasn't sure he would be known by that name here."</p>

<p>"He isn't known by any other!" replied the young lady with a laugh. "He's about, somewhere; I believe he's always
about, somewhere! Mrs. Merriman," she called to a lady in the parlor, "where's the ubiquitous Olly?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Amy," replied the lady. "Didn't he go with the gentlemen in the yacht?"</p>

<p>Amy "almost thought he did"; yet it seemed to her she had seen him that afternoon; a position of uncertainty on the
part of that young lady, which wouldn't have been highly flattering to the vanity of Master Burdeen, even if he hadn't
been at that moment beyond the reach of flattery.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Murcher can tell you," she said, turning to walk back to the end of the hall. "She is here, in the
dining-room."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murcher thought Olly must be in his room.</p>

<p>"I believe he is going home this evening," she said; "he wants to show his folks a new suit of clothes that has been
given him. I guess he's trying them on."</p>

<p>"I am a neighbor of his," said Perce. "I am camping on the beach with some friends; and we want him to join us."</p>

<p>"Well!" exclaimed the landlady, "you can go right up to his room and find him. It's in the old part of the house; but
you'd better go up the front way; it's lighter."</p>

<p>She was explaining to Perce that he must go up one flight, proceed to the end of the corridor, and then step down
into a lower passage&mdash;when the tall young brunette called over the banisters, "I'll show him!"</p>

<p>He mounted after her; and she threw open the door of what seemed an unoccupied room, to let more light from its
windows into the corridor.</p>

<p>"Be careful not to stumble!" she warned him. "That's his room, right before you, as you go down those steps."</p>

<p>So saying, she disappeared in some other room, and Perce was left alone in the dim hall. He paused a moment to get a
glimpse of the sea through the door and window of the room she had opened, which happened to be Mr. Hatville's room;
then he groped his way to Olly's door and knocked.</p>

<p>In a little while, he returned alone to his friends on the beach.</p>

<p>"I couldn't find him," he said. "Mrs. Murcher sent me up to his room, but he wasn't there; and I went all over the
place. Then she said she thought he must have gone home, to show his folks a new suit of clothes; he had asked her if he
might; but she didn't expect him to go so soon."</p>

<p>"Olly's made, if he's got some new clothes!" said Moke.</p>

<p>"He never would speak to us, after that!" said Poke. "Never mind; we can 'wake Nicodemus' without him."</p>

<p>"Wake Nicodemus!" Moke shouted gleefully, to hear his voice resound in the woods.</p>

<p>"Wake Nicodemus!" Poke repeated. And the three joined gayly in the chorus of a song then popular:</p>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<span class="ind1">"Now, run and tell Elijah to hurry up Pomp,</span>
		<span class="ind1">And meet us at the gum-tree down in the swamp,</span>
			<span class="ind4">To wake Nicodemus to-day!"</span>
	</div>
</div>

<p>The very human biped whose cries had been mistaken for a loon's, heard their voices wafted to him by the
wind&mdash;the same wind that was blowing him farther and farther from the shore.</p>

<p>He screamed again, wildly; but his own voice sounded weaker and weaker, while the merry chorus still went up from the
little camping party on the beach:</p>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<span class="ind1">"Wake Nicodemus to-day!"</span>
	</div>
</div>

<p>The boys sang and chatted as they worked. They made their beds in a hollow of the windswept dunes, where there would
be less annoyance from mosquitoes than in the shelter of the woods, and spread their hay and blankets upon the dry
sand.</p>

<p>"Besides," said Perce, "the daylight will strike us here, and wake us early."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">[Pg 689]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wake Nicodemus!" laughed Poke.</p>

<p>And then they all burst forth again:</p>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<span class="ind1">"Wake Nicodemus to-day!"</span>
	</div>
</div>

<p>The chasing clouds gathered, until the sky was almost completely overcast. The moon would not rise till late; it
became dark rapidly. But as the gloom of night thickened on land and sea, a little golden flame shot up on the shore,
and grew large and bright as the surrounding shadows became more dense.</p>

<p>It was the flame of the boys' camp-ire, which they kindled on the seaward side of the dunes, and fed with rubbish
from the high-water mark of the recent storm. Later tides had not then reached it, and plenty of it was dry enough to
burn.</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<img src="images/illus721.jpg" width="505" height="600" alt="Perce and the Twins on Their Way to the Beach." title="" />
<span class="caption">PERCE AND THE TWINS ON THEIR WAY TO THE BEACH.</span>
</div>

<p>Chips and old shingles, bleached sea-weed, broken planks, strips and slabs from saw-mills on some far-away river, and
other refuse, littered the strand,&mdash;here, a broken lobster-pot which the rolling waves had washed ashore, and
there, a ship's fender, worn smooth, with a fragment of rope still held in the auger-hole by its knotted end.</p>

<p>Such of this fuel as best suited their immediate purpose the boys gathered for their fire; and Olly, in his
wave-tossed boat, could see their agile figures running to and fro in the light of the flames.</p>

<p>"There'll be heaps of flood-wood, as well as kelp, for us to gather to-morrow," said Perce. "Don't put any more on
the fire, boys."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the twins.</p>

<p>"There's no use wasting it," answered Perce, adding, "We've fire enough. We'll roast our corn and go to bed, so as to
be up early. It'll be high tide before five to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Then wake Nicodemus!" cried Moke in a gleeful tone.</p>

<p>And again the three boys raised the wild chorus of the old plantation song.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">[Pg 690]</a></span></p>

<p>"Olly ought to be here!" said Perce. "He must have gone home by the coast; and that's the way we missed him."</p>

<p>Even then, but for the noise of the surf and the whistling of the wind, they might have heard Olly's last screams;
and by straining their eyes they might have seen far out on the gloomy deep a dim object, now rising for a moment
against the line of the evening sky, and now disappearing in a hollow of the waves.</p>

<p>With hay about their heads to shelter them from the wind, and the light of their camp-fire gleaming over them, the
kelp-gatherers lay under their blankets, in the hollow of the dunes. They talked or sang until the flames died to a
feeble glimmer, that served to bring out by contrast the surrounding gloom of sea and land and sky.</p>

<p>"Isn't it dark, though!" exclaimed Perce. "I had no idea it would cloud so. I believe it is going to rain. Then
shan't we be in a fix?"</p>

<p>"It can't rain," said Moke.</p>

<p>"No fear of that," added Poke, in a muffled voice from under his blanket.</p>

<p>"What's the reason?" Perce demanded.</p>

<p>"Uncle Moses said so," replied both the twins together.</p>

<p>"Oh, then, of course it can't!" laughed Perce. "And the wind wont change, and carry the kelp all off, and land it on
some other beach, as it did the last time I was coming to get sea-weed here. The wind clipped around to the nor'ard and
northeast, and in the morning this beach, that had been covered with it, was as clean as a whistle; while Coombs's Cove,
where there hadn't been any, was full of it."</p>

<p>"Who's going to wake Nicodemus in the morning?" asked Moke.</p>

<p>"The one who's first awake himself," said Perce. And he sang, the others joining in:</p>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<span class="ind1">"'Wake me up,' was his charge, 'at the first break of day,</span>
		<span class="ind1">Wake me up for the great jubilee!'"</span>
	</div>
</div>

<p>After that they became silent. The fire died on the beach. The breakers plunged and drew back, with incessant noise,
in the darkness; the wind moaned in the woods, and whistled among the coarse sparse grass and wild peas that grew about
the dunes. But notwithstanding the strangeness of their situation, the boys were soon asleep.</p>

<p>Uncle Moses proved a true prophet. There was no rain in the huddling clouds that at one time overspread the sky. They
broke and lifted, and bright stars peeped from under their heavy lids. Then the moon rose and silvered them, and shed a
strange light upon the limitless, unresting, solitary waves.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> VII.</h4>

<h5>ADRIFT IN A DORY.</h5>

<p>For a long time Olly could see the boys by the light of their camp-fire, excepting when the tops of the rolling
billows hid them from view.</p>

<p>Although too far off at any time to recognize his friends, he made out snatches of the song then in vogue in his
neighborhood; and he believed the camping party to be Frog-End boys who had come to the beach for kelp.</p>

<p>Sometimes they passed between him and the fire; and finally they stood or crouched around it, as the wavering flames
died down to a bright-red glow on the shore. To see them so near and so happy&mdash;it seemed to him that everybody was
happy who was not paddling desperately in a frail skiff, against a relentless wind&mdash;to hear them singing and
shouting, so wholly unconscious of him in his distress, was intolerable agony.</p>

<p>"Oh, why can't they hear?" he exclaimed, in a voice to the last degree hoarse with calling for help. "Why couldn't
they look this way once? Now it is too late!"</p>

<p>He was by that time greatly exhausted; for when not signaling and calling, he had been making frantic efforts to
paddle the dory against the wind. At first he had used the oar-handle, but he found it wholly ineffectual. Then he had
torn up one of the thwarts, but it was too short and too clumsy for his purpose; and though for a time he seemed to make
headway, the distance from the shore was steadily increasing.</p>

<p>If he could have held the boat in its course, as with a pair of oars, he might have made progress even with that
unwieldly paddle. But he lost time and strength in shifting it from side to side; and, spite of all he could do, the
wind and the waves would now and then give the light, veering skiff a turn, and he would suddenly find himself paddling
out to sea! However, those efforts prevented him from being blown speedily out of sight of land. And when the boys on
the beach, after due preparation, stuck their ears of green corn on the sharpened ends of sticks and roasted them in the
fire, he still kept the little group in view. He had no doubt that they were cooking their supper. No wonder he wept
with despair at the contrast of that cheerful scene with his own terrible situation!</p>

<p>The fire faded to a red eye of burning coals; all other objects grew indistinct, excepting the black outline of the
woods against the soft evening red of a rift in the sky, and one pure star brightening in those ethereal depths. Another
starry beam, which he could plainly discern, but which was too low down for a star, Olly knew must be a light in one of
the upper windows of the boarding-house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">[Pg 691]</a></span></p>

<p>Was it in Mr. Hatville's room? Had he returned and discovered the loss of his watch? And could poor Olly hope ever to
make restitution and explanations? Suppose he should indeed be lost at sea! Would it not be believed that he had yielded
to temptation and had purposely run away with the watch?</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 570px;">
<img src="images/illus724.jpg" width="570" height="600" alt="''HE MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO PADDLE THE DORY AGAINST THE WIND.''" title="" />
<span class="caption">"HE MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO PADDLE THE DORY AGAINST THE WIND."</span>
</div>

<p>The danger his life was in was enough for the wretched boy, without this fear for his reputation. He thought of his
folks at home,&mdash;his mother and sisters, for his father was dead,&mdash;and he wondered if they would believe him
capable of a folly so much greater than that he had in mind when he so innocently (as it seemed to him then, but not
now) borrowed the bright bauble! And what would Amy Canfield think?</p>

<p>All vanity had been killed in him from the moment he found himself in actual peril. It made him sick at heart to
remember the satisfaction he had so lately felt in his new clothes. He no longer drew the watch proudly from his pocket;
hardly once did he glance downward at the big seal and gold guard hooked in the button-hole of his vest&mdash;a hated
sight to him now.</p>

<p>When all hope of reaching the shore against such a wind was gone, he still struggled to keep the dory within hailing
distance of the yacht, when it should come beating up from the northeast. But no yacht hove in sight; and if it passed,
it must have been under the shadow of the shore. Clouds closed again over the one bright star and the patch of silver
light in the west. The utter desolation of night lay about him on the lonely, weltering waters. All along the coast now
he could see occasional lights&mdash;the lights in happy dwellings; but on the seaward side, only a faint gleam showed
the line where sky and ocean met. There were no sounds but the ceaseless turmoil of the billows, the frequent slapping
of a wave under the flat-bottomed boat, and his own fitful sobs.</p>

<p>His last hope lay in crossing the track of some coaster or fishing-craft that might pick him up. But could that occur
before morning? And could he expect that his ill-managed dory would ride safely all night on the increasing waves? The
strong wind off shore, meeting the ocean swells, was blowing up a heavy chop-sea that threatened a new danger. What a
night was before him, at the best!</p>

<p>Suddenly his hat blew off, and disappeared immediately on the black waves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">[Pg 692]</a></span></p>

<p>The distant sails he had seen at first had vanished as the swift night shut down; but now he discerned two dim lights
in different directions, evidently far away.</p>

<p>He was gazing after them, and looking anxiously for nearer lights or sails, when he was aware of a low, dark object
just before him, rising from the deep. What could it be?&mdash;with something white flashing upon it! And what was the
sound he heard?</p>

<p>"The Cow and Calf!" he exclaimed, with sudden excitement, almost as if he had seen a friend.</p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> VIII.</h4>

<h5>THE COW AND CALF.</h5>

<p>"The Old Cow" and "The Calf" are two enormous ledges lying not far asunder, within sight from the coast in clear
weather. "The Cow" is never completely submerged; her bare brown back appears above the highest tides.</p>

<p>"The Calf" is not so fortunate; the sea must be very calm at high water, when it is not buried in the surf.</p>

<p>Near one end of it, to mark the position of the dangerous reef, a pole is anchored, rising out of the water with a
slant that has gained for it the name of "The Calf's Tail." Often at high tide the tail only can be seen sticking out of
the sea.</p>

<p>What Olly saw and heard was the billows combing over the end of one of those huge rocks. He wondered why he hadn't
thought of them before; for it now occurred to him that if he could land on "The Old Cow," he might safely pass the
night on her back, and be seen from the shore, or from some passing craft, in the morning.</p>

<p>But which of the ledges was he approaching? Familiar as their forms were to him, seen from the shore, he could not in
his strange position, in the night, and amid the dashing waves, decide whether he was coming upon "The Old Cow" or "The
Calf."</p>

<p>Trembling with fresh hope and fear, and paddling cautiously, he strained his eyes in the darkness, to get the broad
outline of the ledge against the faint sky-line. There was something awful in the sound of the surf on those desolate
rocks. The surges leapt and fell, rushing along the reef and pouring in dimly-seen cataracts over the ledges, their loud
buffets followed by mysterious gurglings and murmurings, which might well appall the heart of a wave-tossed boy.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing him on; but it was still in his power to pass the end of the rock, or drive his dory upon the
windward side, where the ocean swells broke with least force. If he could only be sure which rock it was! But he could
distinguish nothing. All was as strange to him as if he had been adrift on the lonesomest unknown sea in the world.</p>

<p>If it was "The Calf," then "The Tail" should be at the other end, and "The Old Cow" beyond. If "The Cow," "The Calf"
must be in the other direction, and a little farther seaward; he might pass between the two.</p>

<p>He was getting used to his clumsy paddle; with it he kept his dory off as well as he could, but in a state of
terrible anxiety, thinking his life might depend on what he should decide to do the next minute. He was still
hesitating, when accident decided for him.</p>

<p>The skiff was headed to the wind, against which he continued to paddle, when suddenly a billow shot over a sunken
projection of the ledge, smiting the end of the boat with a force that slung it half about in an instant.</p>

<p>Olly felt a small deluge of water dash over and drench him from behind. He was past thinking of his new clothes now;
he thought of the dory. Even then it might have escaped capsizing if it had not met at the same instant a cross-wave,
which tumbled aboard from the other side.</p>

<p>The two filled it so nearly that the water rushed cold across his knees; and he knew that nothing he could do would
prevent the boat from sinking. Indeed, as the very next wave swept in, it settled on one side, and then slowly rolled
over. To save himself, Olly sprang up, grasping first the uppermost rail, then clinging to the bottom of the overturned
skiff, until another billow swept him off.</p>

<p>He was an accomplished swimmer, as I think I have said before; and now that skill stood him in good stead. In the
first moment of his immersion he lost his bearings; but rising with a wave, he looked about him from its crest, and saw
the little island not a hundred feet away.</p>

<p>He made for it at once, directing his course to a spot which the overleaping surge did not reach.</p>

<p>The waves were dashing all about the rock, to be sure; and to land safely upon it at any point would require not only
vigilance, but good fortune.</p>

<p>I hardly know whether he was much frightened or not; he himself couldn't have told. He didn't stop for a moment to
reason about the situation, but obeying the mere instinct of self-preservation, he swam to the ledge.</p>

<p>He was lucky enough to find a spot where it sloped gently into the sea. He swam in on a wave, and as it subsided, he
clung to the rock.</p>

<p>The broken surface of the rock was covered with barnacles, which cut his hands; but he held on. They also scratched
his knees through his torn

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">[Pg 693]</a></span>

clothing, as he climbed up to the smoother rocks above.</p>

<p>The slant to the water was such that he could not, in the darkness, judge of his elevation above the sea-level; nor
could he determine, from that, whether he had been thrown upon "The Old Cow" or "The Calf."</p>

<p>Yet everything depended upon the answer to that question. If on the greater rock, he was comparatively safe; if on
the smaller, his respite would be brief&mdash;he might expect the next tide to carry him off.</p>

<p>Groping about on the jagged summit, trying to identify the rock by its form, his foot plashed in a pool of water. He
paused, startled by the thought that here was a means of deciding his fate.</p>

<p>No doubt, much sea-spray dashed upon the back even of "The Old Cow," in rough weather. But copious rains had
succeeded the last gale; and so, if that little pool was on the large rock, the water it held could not be very salt. If
on the back of "The Calf," it was the leavings of the last tide. He felt that his doom was in the taste of that
water.</p>

<p>He hesitated, heaving a sigh of dread; then he stooped quickly and put his hand into the pool. He lifted the wet
fingers to his lips, and immediately grew faint&mdash;the water was bitterly salt.</p>

<p>Still, after a little reflection, he would not give up all hope. The sea must have broken clear over "The Cow's"
back, in the last storm; and the rain might have had little effect in freshening the contents of the basin. He thought
of another test.</p>

<p>Barnacles live in the sea, or in receptacles of sea-water replenished at every tide. If he was upon the back of "The
Old Cow," the pool would be free from them; if on "The Calf," there would be the usual incrustations about its
edges.</p>

<p>Once more he put down his groping hand; and then he uttered a despairing wail.</p>

<p>The barnacles were there!</p>

<h2>AUNT DEBORAH'S LESSON.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By G. H. Baskette.</span></h3>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 138px;">

</div>


<p><br />he good lands! What's that!" excitedly cried frightened Aunt Deborah.</p>

<p>Aunt Deborah might well exclaim in surprise. For as she sat knitting quietly and humming a quaint old tune of long
ago, one she had learned as a child&mdash;&mdash;C-r-rash! bang! came a stone into the room, shivering the window-pane,
just missing the swinging lamp in the hallway, making an ugly scar on the cabinet, and breaking into fragments a
handsome vase. Then, as if satisfied with the mischief it had done, it rolled lazily across the floor, and finally
stopped under the table, an inert, jagged bit of granite.</p>

<p>Aunt Deborah, as the stone pursued its reckless course, placed her hands over her head, and shrank back into her
chair, a frightened and unwilling witness to the destruction of her property. It was quite distressing.</p>

<p>Besides the nervous shock, there was the broken window; there was the cabinet showing a great white dent that could
not easily be removed; and there, too, was the vase she had kept so many long years, lying shattered and ruined before
her eyes.</p>

<p>Aunt Deborah was one of the best and most kind-hearted of women; but&mdash;she was human, and the sudden havoc
wrought by the missile exasperated as well as frightened her. She rushed to the window and opened it in time to see
three or four boys scampering down the street as fast as their legs could carry them.</p>

<p>"Oh, you young scapegraces!" she cried. "If I could once lay hold on you, wouldn't I teach you a lesson!"</p>

<p>But the boys never stopped until they had disappeared around a friendly corner. Aunt Deborah was so overcome by the
accident, and so intent upon watching the retreating boys to whom she desired to teach a lesson, that she did not at
first notice a barefooted lad standing under the window on the pavement below, holding a battered old hat in his hand,
and looking up at her with a scared face and tearful eyes.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss," said the boy tremulously.</p>

<p>"Oh! Who are you? Who threw that stone at my window?" called out Aunt Deborah, as she spied him.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss," pleaded the boy, fumbling nervously his torn hat, "I threw it, but I didn't mean to do it."</p>

<p>"Didn't mean to do it, eh?" replied Aunt Deborah, fiercely. "I suppose the stone picked itself up and pitched itself
through my glass!"</p>

<p>"I was going to throw it down the street, but Bill Philper touched my arm, and it turned and hit your window," he
explained.</p>

<p>There was an air of frankness and truth about the boy, and the fact that he had not run away like the others (whom,
somehow, Aunt Deborah held chiefly responsible for the outrage), caused her to relent a little toward him.</p>

<p>"Come in here," she said, after eying him closely for a moment.</p>

<p>The lad hesitated; but summoning all his courage, he went up the steps, and soon stood in her presence.</p>

<p>"Do you see that" she said, pointing at the window&mdash;"and that"&mdash;(at the cabinet)&mdash;"and
that?"&mdash;(at the broken vase)&mdash;"and that?"&mdash;(at the stone.) "Now, isn't that a fine performance?"</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," said the boy, the tears welling into his eyes again.</p>

<p>He looked ruefully about at the damaged articles, and glanced at the stone, wishing heartily that he had never seen
it.</p>

<p>"Now, what's to be done about it?" asked she.</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am," said he, very ill at ease. "I will try to pay you for it."</p>

<p>"What can you pay, I should like to know?" she said, glancing at his patched coat and trousers and his torn hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">[Pg 695]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sell papers," said he; "and I can pay you a little on it every week."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Sam Wadley," answered the boy.</p>

<p>"Have you a father?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," replied Sam; "he's dead."</p>

<p>"Have you a mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"What does she do?" continued Aunt Deborah.</p>

<p>"She sews, and I help her all I can, selling papers."</p>

<p>"How can you pay me anything then?"</p>

<div class="imgcenter" style="width: 550px;">

<span class="caption">"THERE SAT AUNT DEBORAH EARNESTLY KNITTING." [<a href="#Page_696">SEE NEXT PAGE.</a>]</span>
</div>

<p>"Please, ma'am, I'll tell Mother all about it, and she'll be willing for me to pay you all I make."</p>

<p>"Well, now, we'll see if you are a boy to keep his word," said Aunt Deborah.</p>

<p>"How much must I pay?" Sam inquired anxiously.</p>

<p>"Let me see." Aunt Deborah put on her spectacles and made a critical survey of the room. "Window&mdash;fifty cents;
vase&mdash;one dollar&mdash;I wouldn't have had it broken for five!&mdash;That'll do&mdash;one dollar and a half. I
shan't charge you for the dent in the furniture."</p>

<p>"I'll try to pay you something on it every week," said Sam. "There are some days when I don't make anything; but when
I do, I'll save it for you."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Aunt Deborah; "you may go now."</p>

<p>He thanked her, and went slowly out, while Aunt Deborah began to pick up the fragments strewn over the floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a moment!" she cried.</p>

<p>Sam came back.</p>

<p>"Take this stone out with you, and be careful what you do with it, next time," she said. "By

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">[Pg 696]</a></span>

the way, if you wish to keep out of trouble, you'd better not keep company with that Flipper boy&mdash;" Aunt Deborah
had a rather poor memory for names&mdash;"if I had him, wouldn't I give him a lesson!"</p>

<p>She uttered the last sentence with such a relish, that Sam was glad enough to get away. He was afraid she might
conclude to bestow upon him the salutary lesson which she had proposed to give "Flipper," as she called him.</p>

<p>Sam hurried home as fast as he could. His mother, a pale, delicate woman whose wan features and sunken eyes showed
the effects of too hard work, heard his simple tale, wiped away his tears and encouraged him in his resolve to pay for
the damage he had done.</p>

<p>From that day, Sam began to be very diligent, and to earn pennies in every honest way possible to him. And every week
he carried some small amount to Aunt Deborah.</p>

<p>"That boy has some good in him," she said when he had brought his first installment. And though she grew more kind
toward him every time he came, occasionally giving him a glass of milk, a sandwich or a cake, she rarely failed to warn
him against the influence of that "Flipper" boy.</p>

<p>His young companions laughed at him for paying his money to Aunt Deborah, and called him a coward for not running
away when they ran; but all they said did not turn him from his purpose.</p>

<p>One evening he went with a cheerful heart to pay his last installment.</p>

<p>As he passed the window of the sitting-room he glanced in. There sat Aunt Deborah, earnestly knitting. The lamplight
fell upon her sober face and Sam wondered if she ever looked really smiling and pleasant. "It doesn't seem as though she
would be so stiff with a fellow," he said to himself. Then, in response to her "Come in," he entered the room and handed
her his money.</p>

<p>"I believe that is all, ma'am," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, that pays the whole sum," said Aunt Deborah; "you have done well."</p>

<p>"I am still very sorry I have troubled you, and I hope you forgive me," he said.</p>

<p>"I do, with all my heart," said she earnestly.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Sam, as he started out, picking his old hat from the floor, where he had placed it; on
entering.</p>

<p>"Come back," said Aunt Deborah, "I've something more to say to you."</p>

<p>With a startled look he turned into the room.</p>

<p>Aunt Deborah went to the cabinet and unlocked it. She first took out a pair of new shoes, then half a dozen pairs of
socks, some underclothing, two nice shirts, a neat woolen suit, and lastly a good felt hat.</p>

<p>"Sam," said she to the astonished lad, "I have taken your money, not because I wanted it, but because I wished to
test you. I wished to see whether you really meant to pay me. That Flipper boy would never have done it, I am sure. You
have done so well in bringing me your little savings that I have learned to like you very much. Now I wish to make you a
present of these articles. In the pocket of this jacket you will find the money you have paid me. I wouldn't take a cent
of it. It is yours. You must keep working and adding to it, so that you can soon help your mother more. Go to work now
with a light heart, and grow up a true and an honest man. Tell your mother that I say she has a fine son."</p>

<p>In making this speech, Aunt Deborah's features relaxed into a pleasant smile; and Sam smiled too, and was so pleased
that he could hardly utter his thanks.</p>

<p>"And mind you," continued she, suddenly changing the current of his thoughts, "don't associate with that Flipper
boy!"</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am," said Sam, feeling a twinge of conscience that his former companion should bear so much of the blame,
"you have been very kind to me, but Bill Philper didn't know the stone would turn as it did, and break your window."</p>

<p>"Then why did he run away?" inquired Aunt Deborah somewhat fiercely. "It's quite proper that you should try to excuse
him, Sam; but I should like to teach him a good lesson?"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;have taught me a good lesson," said Sam, with a blushing face, "and I&mdash;I&mdash;thank you
very much for it."</p>

<p>Aunt Deborah smiled benignly again, and warmly bidding Sam to come often to see her, she let him out at the door.</p>

<p>She felt very happy as Sam disappeared down the street, and he was very happy, as he hurried home with his great
bundle, and told his mother all about it, which made that good woman very happy, too. So they were very happy all
around.</p>

<p>And it all came about because Sam had stood up like a brave boy to confess his wrong, which is always manly; and had
offered reparation for it, which is always right; and had gone forward, in spite of the taunts of his companions,
denying himself pleasures and comforts in order to do that which he knew to be right, which is always heroic.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Boat-Building.</span></h4>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/illus734.jpg" width="200" height="250" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Boat-building is by no means one of the "lost arts," although in this age of steam and iron, the "good old days" of
the ship-builders are a thing of the past. Of late years, however, there has been a marked increase in the trade, and
although the work is confined principally to yachts and smaller craft, the steady growth of this branch of boat-building
offers excellent inducements to any young man whose tastes lie in that direction.</p>

<p>I know of one boy at least, now sixteen years of age, who intends to fit himself during the next five or six years
for the occupation; and his father, a prominent and highly successful naval architect, believes that there is a very
promising future for American boat-building.</p>

<p>I take it for granted that the future boat-builder has, as a boy, been fond of boats. He has not only taken advantage
of the rivers and ponds near his house, has navigated them in scow, in row-boat or in sail-boat, but I will suppose
that, from the time he has been the owner of a jack-knife, he has been a constructor of toy boats. And, as he has grown
older and become the possessor of a tool-chest, or, at least, of a gauge, a mallet, a saw, a plane, and a good knife, he
has wrought out miniature cutters and schooners, possibly a square-rigged ship, all of which have been much admired by
his young companions. If it has been his object in life to become a boat-builder, he could not have been better employed
during the hours that have not been taken up with school duties.</p>

<p>In every business and profession there is some one object above all others sought after, upon which success may be
said to depend. The orator endeavors to arouse our enthusiasm, the poet appeals to our sentiments, the lawyer to our
reason, the clergyman to our conscience. The genius of the boat-builder lies in the one word "form." The one thing more
than all others for which he aims to have a reputation is the ability to give a good shape to the mass of wood or iron
coming from his hands, whether it be a man-of-war or a sail-boat. And so it was good for the boy that he made boats and
models of boats. He was getting, as the naval architect would say, "form impressed upon his brain." It may have been, it
probably was, a bad form, an incorrect form, but it was something from which to start. At all events, the boy has formed
a speaking acquaintance with the occupation he is about to enter.</p>

<p>I shall assume that at the age of sixteen he has finished his school studies, has a good knowledge of arithmetic and
algebra, and has gone through seven books in Euclid, with special reference to being proficient in the fourth and
seventh books. Two years before this, we will suppose, he has expressed a desire to be a boat-builder. He has made a
model of some kind of a boat, and he has, as occasions have permitted, visited such ship-ards as could be found in his
vicinity, and carefully watched the men while they were at work. At last, at the age of sixteen, he enters the office of
a thoroughly competent naval architect, who either is or has been a practical ship-builder. The naval architect stands
in the same relation to ship-building that the architect of houses does to house-building, with this
difference,&mdash;not only does he make the plan, but very often he executes it as well.</p>

<p>The beginner will find his quarters very pleasant. The room will be light, cheerful, and quiet. On the walls he will
probably see pictures of famous yachts or other vessels; there will be a small library of technical books of reference,
which he will have occasion to consult later on; there may be another student with whom he will chat now and then during
the day; or his teacher, while they are at work, may give him some stirring bits of yachting reminiscence. I only
mention this to show that there is none of that strict discipline to which the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">[Pg 699]</a></span>

boy has been accustomed at school. The fact is, it is not needed, for, to use the language of a well-known ship-builder,
"it is a fascinating occupation; it grows upon you; and the longer you are in it, the better you like it, that is, of
course, if you like boats and everything pertaining to them."</p>

<p>The boy will at first be given the drawing of a midship, or central, section of a boat, and required to put a body to
it, to give it a bow, a stern&mdash;in short, to give to the boat its form. After working in that way for a while, he
will make more extended plans, until he is able to make the full design of a vessel. He will remain with this naval
architect for the space of a year; and, by that time, he should have acquired a very good knowledge of form.</p>

<p>It is a fact that boys in England who choose this occupation for their life-work can more easily obtain a thorough
education in it than can be had by youths in our country. In England, and in France, Denmark, and other European
countries, there are schools where special technical instruction is given, and many of these are close to large
ship-yards, where the practical work of ship-building can constantly be seen. The question now arises, therefore, shall
the boy go to England and get the benefit of this instruction? It is by no means necessary that he should go there; but
if he has begun to learn while young, he can spare the time, and his parents know whether they can spare the money which
such a journey and residence would entail. If he decides to go, he will remain away for three or four years.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, it is decided that he can not go abroad. It has cost him for the year's instruction he has received
from the naval architect, with whom he had been studying, about $1000; or, he has given his services as a draughtsman,
paid $500, and during the twelve months has "picked up" such knowledge as he could without receiving any regular
instruction. His case of drawing-instruments has cost him from $50 to $250, depending on the number of instruments, the
manner in which they are finished and the style of the case in which they are kept. Let us assume that he has been a
full-pay pupil. His time is, of course, his own. It would be a good plan, after he has acquired some theoretical
knowledge of the business, to regularly visit a shipyard and there begin to do the practical work which falls to the lot
of the boat-builder; studying in the office one-half the time and working in the yard the other half. Now you will see,
as I observed before, that boat-building is a profession and a trade. It is possible to be simply a naval architect and
only make designs for boats, but it is not advisable; it is better, by all means, to have the practical knowledge which
is obtained working among the men in the shipyard.</p>

<p>They do not now apprentice boys as they did some fifty years ago. I have before me an indenture paper of a
ship-builder (now alive) dated in the year 1825. In it he promises "not to waste his master's goods; not to contract
matrimony within the said term; not to play at cards, dice, or any unlawful game, nor frequent ale-houses, dance-houses,
or play-houses, but in all things behave himself as a faithful apprentice ought to do during the said term." There are
no such rules laid down nowadays. Perhaps all the boys are so good that none are needed. All that needs to be done now
is for the boy to make his verbal agreement with the owner of the shipyard, and go to work.</p>

<p>And now a word or two as to this practical work which will cover the second method of learning boat-building as
mentioned at the beginning of my paper. The boy who has not had the benefit of any previous training with an instructor
may have to commence with turning the grindstone. The tools used in boat-building are in such constant use that they
grow dull very soon, and the grindstone is kept going almost the whole of the day. Besides, the work being very heavy,
the men generally work in couples, so that the learner when he is not turning the grindstone is assisting in lifting the
heavy timbers that have to be used. The first tool he is generally permitted to use is the saw; then he begins to use
the adze; then he is trusted with the ax, and helps get out the planking and timber for the frame of the ship.</p>

<p>Then comes the difficult part of construction. The apprentice must have learned all this work with the tools (of
which I am only able to make a passing mention), before he comes to the constructive part; that is, the part that our
pupil has been studying with the naval architect.</p>

<p>Before the building of the ship is commenced, a small wooden model is made, to give the owner and the builder an idea
of what she is going to look like.</p>

<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<span class="ind1">"A little model the master wrought,</span>
		<span class="ind1">Which should be to the larger plan</span>
		<span class="ind1">What the child is to the man."</span>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Doubtless, you have seen such models. They are built sometimes on a scale of a quarter of an inch to a foot; they are
made of pieces of cedar and pine wood, placed alternately, and show the shape and whole arrangement of one side of the
vessel. This model is glued, on its flat side, to a piece of board, for greater convenience in examination.</p>

<p>From this model, "life-size" plans of the ship are made with chalk on the floor of a long, wide room, like a big
garret, which is used especially for

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">[Pg 700]</a></span>

this purpose. It will not be necessary to enter into a technical description of these plans. There are three of
them,&mdash;the sheer plan, the half-breadth plan, and the body plan. They show the position of the different planks to
be used in the construction of the ship. To gain a rough idea of these plans, take a cucumber, decide which you will
call the bottom and which the top, and cut it in the middle, lengthwise, from end to end. Look into its interior and
fancy that it is covered with lines, both horizontal and vertical&mdash;and that will give you a very rough idea of the
sheer plan. By laying the cucumber on its side and cutting it lengthwise, you will have a notion of the half-breadth
plan. A division in the middle (cutting it in two parts, so that you can see the whole circumference) may suggest to you
the body plan. This can not be made very clear, not even with drawings, because it is the most technical part of the
work; but its object is apparent. From these three plans, taken from different points of view, the boat-builder can
locate the position of every piece of plank in his vessel. So true is this that I understand it is possible to number
the planks of a ship, and send them off to some distant country, where a ship-builder can construct the vessel without
ever having seen the design.</p>

<p>A great deal of calculation and figuring enters into this part of the work, but much of it has been made easy by the
aid of a man (now dead, I believe) named Simpson, the author of what are called "Simpson's Rules." These rules are
incorporated in small pocket handbooks which contain, in addition, a large number of tables, rules, and formulas
pertaining to naval architecture. The most popular handbook of this character in England is said to be "Mackrow's Naval
Architect and Ship-builders' Assistant," and in our country, "Haswell's Engineers' Pocket-book of Tables." These,
however, are only aids in making calculations, and are very much like the interest tables you have probably seen, which
save the trouble of going through the figuring in detail. There are a great many books which will be interesting and
valuable to the young ship-builder. To give you some idea of their character, I copy the following from the table of
contents of a recent standard work: "The displacement and buoyancy of ships;" "The oscillations of ships in still
water;" "The oscillation of ships among waves;" "Methods of observing the rolling and pitching motions of ships;" "The
structural strength of ships," etc.</p>

<p>These titles may not at present indicate a very promising literary feast, but when the young boat-builder has
mastered the rudiments of the technical part of the profession, he will read and reread such productions with as much
pleasure as he now peruses the stories in <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span>.</p>

<p>I have not entered into the details of iron ship-building, the practical part of which the boy will learn in the same
yard in which he learns to work in wood; for it is presumed that he is going to some large yard to obtain his
instruction. Indeed, in this occupation it is the practical part that is the easiest and the most interesting to young
learners. They are apt to slight the theoretical knowledge required and to long to spend their time in the shipyard with
real tools, doing real work, for a real ship. With the boy who, through force of circumstances, has to enter on the life
of a journeyman and earn wages, there is more excuse for hastening to that branch of the work than for the lad who is
better situated in life. The journeyman will learn construction last and from his master. Under the plan I have
suggested, the other lad will learn the general principles of construction before he goes to the shipyard; at least he
will not have to commence with turning the grindstone. His first few visits will be confined to watching the men at
their work; then he will gradually make himself familiar with the use of the different tools.</p>

<p>The journeyman will receive at first $1 a day; during the second year, $1.50 a day, and be gradually advanced until
he receives the regular wages, at the present time from $3 to $3.25 a day. It would not be advisable to make any
estimate of the profits of boat-building as a business, for, no matter what they are now, by the time my young reader
has started a shipyard, they may be entirely different, owing to the increase or decrease in the cost of material and
labor.</p>

<h2>CAPTAIN JACK'S FOURTH-OF-JULY KITE.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Daniel C. Beard.</span></h3>

<div class="imgright" style="width: 509px;">
<img src="images/illus741a.jpg" width="509" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>"Well, if that isn't the queerest sight!" exclaimed a passenger on the cars going from Flushing to New York, last
Independence Day.</p>

<p>And all the passengers on that train, and on all other trains during the day, echoed the same words. It was a very
strange occurrence.</p>

<p>Away up in the blue sky, and all alone, like a new declaration of independence, fluttered that soul-stirring piece of
bunting, the stars and stripes. Not a sign of pole or support of any kind could the sharpest eye discern; and yet, as
steadily as if fixed on the dome of the national capitol, it waved its gay stripes in the joyous breeze. It was a very
mysterious flag.</p>

<p>There was, however, one individual who was both able and willing to clear away the mystery&mdash;a certain jovial man
who, on the morning of that particular day, sat in exceedingly airy attire on the front porch of the boathouse of the
Nereus Boat Club. As his striped shirt, knee-breeches, and skull-cap indicated, Captain Jack Walker was an oarsman.</p>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 488px;">
<img src="images/illus741b.jpg" width="488" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He afterward explained to his faithful crew that he had gone to the boathouse early that morning, and while there had
been struck with a novel idea. The result of that idea was the mysterious flag which was waving over the salt marsh by
Flushing Bay, and was puzzling the brains of many good citizens.</p>

<p>Fastened to the top of the flagpole of the club's boathouse was the end of a piece of hempen twine. By following that
piece of twine, which ran away into space at an angle of sixty degrees, the eye came at length to the floating flag. By
looking closely, moreover, one could gradually discern that from the flag the twine ran up five or six hundred feet
higher to a tiny kite&mdash;tiny, as seen away up there in the blue ether; but, in fact, a monster kite.</p>

<p>Captain Jack had first sent up that great kite which some one had left at the boathouse, and had let it out five or
six hundred feet; then he took a flag about five feet long, which belonged to one of the boats, and fastened

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">[Pg 703]</a></span>

the upper end of its stick firmly to the kitestring. He next broke the lower end of the flagstick so as to leave a short
projection (<em>a</em>), just long enough for him to fasten a piece of twine to it.</p>

<p>Then he again let the kite out, and also the string he had attached to the lower end of the flagstick. As soon as the
flagstick was vertical, the line <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> (<a href="#Page_702">see preceding page</a>) was knotted
securely to the kitestring at <em>b</em>. All that was necessary then was to let out about five hundred feet more twine,
and Captain Jack's Fourth-of-July kite was soon gayly flying. There was to be a regatta that afternoon, however, and the
gallant oarsman could not sit idly holding a kitestring in his hand. So he hauled down the boat club's flag, tied the
kitestring to the flag-halyards and then hoisted both flag and kitestring to the top of the flagpole; and so his
Fourth-of-July banner floated serenely in the sky all day long,&mdash;a beautiful sight, and an object of much surprise
and wonder to all who saw it.</p>

<h2>TIPPIE AND JIMMIE.</h2>
<h3><span class="smcap">By Mary L. French.</span></h3>

<p>Tippie and Jimmie had come over to play with Ajax. Tip's whole name is Tippecanoe. The boys call him a black and tan,
but Bessie calls him a darling. He has a little black shining nose that he is always sticking into everything, and a
little smooth, tapering tail that he is always wagging. Jimmie's name is James Stuart; he is a little Maltese kitten,
with gentle blue eyes, and soft fur that is always ready to be smoothed, and claws that are never used where they can
hurt, and a purr that is always wound up.</p>

<p>Tippie and Jimmie live together, and eat together, and are the best of friends.</p>

<p>Ajax is the kitten that lives next door. He is jet black, excepting a little white spot where his cravat should have
been tied. And he has a long black tail that often waves over his back like a banner. He has large green eyes that snap
and shine when he plays, and he has just begun to look for mice.</p>

<p>One day Tippie and Jimmie came around to the kitchen door of the house where Ajax lived, and looked in.</p>

<p>They could not see Ajax, so Jimmie began to climb up the screen door, sticking his claws into the holes. He had not
climbed far before the lady of the house saw him, and she said:</p>

<p>"Here's Jimmie looking for Ajax. Come, Ajax, where are you?"</p>

<p>Ajax was asleep on the lounge, but he jumped up and came running to the door, for he comes when he is called,
"quicker than any of the other children," Mamie says.</p>

<p>He touched noses with Jimmie, and then he took his visitors around to the front porch. There, he and Jimmie leaped
upon a chair and shook their paws at Tippie, who was on the floor. Then Tippie got upon another chair, and Ajax ran
under it and reached up to play with him.</p>

<p>It really seemed as if they knew how pretty they looked. After a while, they all three had a good race up and down,
over chairs, under chairs, and through chairs. Sometimes Ajax stood on the back of a chair and poked his paw at Tippie,
and sometimes he ran to the top of a high rocking-chair and jumped down to the porch railing. Jimmie was not so
venturesome, however.</p>

<p>Soon they grew tired of such play, and then they rushed out-of-doors, and down upon the grass. There, Tippie began to
tease Jimmie. He pushed him over, and stepped upon him, and nosed him, and even bit him gently, till Jimmie suddenly
cried out, "Meow-ow-ow!"</p>

<p>Ajax had been quietly looking on, with a shade of contempt on his handsome countenance; but when he heard that
appeal, he rushed at Tippie and pushed him away from Jimmie and scratched him, and chased him from one end of the yard
to the other, two or three times.</p>

<p>When they stopped to rest after their run, Ajax settled himself comfortably on the grass, perfectly quiet, except for
the tip of his tail, which moved just a little. Tippie watched that tail with longing. He danced around and around Ajax.
He pranced forward and skipped back, and practiced all his dancing-steps, before he dared touch it. At last he boldly
rushed upon it, and a moment later Ajax held him fast around the neck, and with heads close together, and smothered
growls of happiness, the cat and the dog were rolling over and over. Then, they suddenly let go, and stood half a foot
apart, glaring at each other for a second, before they rushed together again, and went through the whole frolic once
more.</p>

<p>Mamie and Herbert had seen it all while building ships, in the side yard, and as they watched the grand closing
scene, Herbert, in the tone of an oracle, announced,</p>

<p>The Moral:</p>

<p>"It is good to be good-natured, but bad to be imposed upon."</p>

She lives all alone, and leaves her coop every night, and goes in the barn, and flies up on old Jim's back, and sleeps
there all night. Old Jim is a horse. Old Jim has a blanket for cold nights. It is an old

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">[Pg 711]</a></span>

one, and there is a hole in it on the top, and the old hen walks all around till
she finds that hole, and puts her feet in there where it is warm, and there we
find her every morning.</p>

<p>My other funny pet is an old cat, named Catharine. She has only three
feet, but I liked her just as well as I ever did, till last summer, when one morning
we found the bird-cage door pushed in, and the bird was gone. We
have another cat. We don't know but the bird flew away; but who pushed
the door in? I don't like any cats so well now. Your friend,</p>

<p>This is a very touching epistle, my hearers, and Tommy has my hearty sympathy. There must be such a place as he is
looking for, though the Deacon says that in the course of a long life he has never happened upon the exact locality.
According to the Little School-ma'am, too, it is not described in any of the geographies; but she says that, for the
sake of all concerned, it is very desirable that the missing paradise of little drummer boys should be
discovered;&mdash;to which the Deacon adds, "Perhaps that's why the grown folk wish to find the North Pole."</p>

<p>While we are upon this subject, here is a letter describing some tiny drummers that make almost as much noise as
patriotic youngsters, and do quite as much mischief. To his credit, however, it must be said that this other small
musician only makes his appearance as a drummer once in seventeen years. Is he bent on setting an example, I wonder? He
is called</p>

<h2>THE SEVENTEEN-YEAR LOCUST.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jack:</span> The seventeen-year locust isn't a locust at all. This may seem a strange thing
to say, but it is true, nevertheless. The locust looks very much like a grasshopper, while the seventeen-year cicada,
which is the insect's proper name, looks a great deal more like a gigantic fly than anything else.</p>

<p>There is a cicada which comes every year, and is also wrongly called a locust. Anybody who has been in the country
about harvest-time has heard the shrill noise made by this cicada and probably has come upon his cast-off shell sticking
to a fence-rail or a tree-trunk.</p>

<p>The seventeen-year cicada is a cousin of the one-year chap; though, as he comes only once in every seventeen years,
he is probably only a far-away cousin. Fancy spending the best part of your life prowling about in the darkness
underground and then coming up into the sunlight with a gorgeous pair of wings, only to die in a short time!</p>

<p>That is what the seventeen-year cicada does. In the very first place, it is an egg which its mother deposits in a
tiny hole in a twig. In a few weeks it makes its way out of the egg and drops to the ground, into which it burrows, and
in which it remains for nearly seventeen years before it is prepared for life above ground.</p>

<p>When, at last, it is ready for the bright sunlight, it may be one foot from the surface or it may be ten feet deep in
the ground. In either case it begins to dig upward until it finds its way out, when it climbs up the nearest tree and
fastens itself by its sharp claws to a leaf or twig. There it waits until its back splits open, and behold! it
immediately crawls out of itself, so to speak.</p>

<p>The new insect is a soft, dull fellow at first, but he grows as if he had been storing up energy for seventeen years
for just that one purpose. Within an hour, two pairs of most beautiful wings have grown, and in a few hours more it has
become hard and active.</p>

<div class="imgleft" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus756a.jpg" width="400" height="263" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The female cicadas are quiet enough, but the males are as noisy as so many little boys with new drums. Indeed, they
do have drums themselves. Just under their wings are drums made of shiny membrane as beautiful as white silk, and these
are kept rattling almost all the time.</p>

<p>One cicada can make noise enough; but imagine the din of
millions of them all going at the same time. It sounds as if all the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">[Pg 713]</a></span>

frogs in the country had come together to try to drown the noise of
a saw-mill. Now it is the saw-mill you hear, and now the frogs.</p>

<p>It sounds like a big story to say millions, but if you could go into the woods where they are, you might be willing
to say billions. I have counted over a thousand cast-off shells on one small tree, and on one birch leaf I have seen
twelve shells. And the earth in some places is like a sieve from the holes made by the cicadas as they came out.</p>

<p>But within a few weeks from the insects' first appearance their eggs have been laid and the cicadas have all died. A
great many of them are eaten by the birds and chickens, but most of them simply can not live any longer.</p>

<p>Yours truly,</p>

<h2>"THE GREAT LUBBER LOCUST."</h2>

<div class="imgright" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/illus756c.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As it appears from Mr. Coryell's letter that the seventeen-year cicada is only an imitation locust, I shall give you
a portrait of another member of the family who is, perhaps, more nearly related to the insect he is named after. At all
events, he is certainly more like a grasshopper than is the seventeen-year cicada. The grasshopper that lives in this
part of the world is a fine fellow to hop, as you know, but he always lights on his feet, and looks as composed and as
much at his ease as if he had walked to the spot in the most dignified manner.</p>

<p>Well, now look at this picture! See one absurd fellow lying on his back and pawing the air with all his long legs,
and another, like a circus clown, standing on his own foolish green head. Would you think these awkward and ridiculous
creatures bore any relationship to the grave little hoppers who gently alight on your clothes as you run through the
grass, stop a moment to stare at you with their great goggle eyes, and then take leave without saying
"good-morning"?</p>

<p>He is no less than a cousin, I assure you, from the Far West, the great plains where few beasts, birds, or insects
can find enough to live upon. This fellow does not suffer for food; he is the biggest of his family in America, and his
curious performances have brought him several names. By some people he is called "the clumsy grasshopper," and by others
he is dubbed "the great lubber locust," while by the scientific men, as usual, he has been given a long Latin name. Of
course, you will be so eager to know it that you will wish to find it out for yourselves!</p>


<h2>THE DOG AND THE QUEER GRASSHOPPERS.</h2>

<p>By the way, a story is told of a dog that was fond of snapping up grasshoppers, and eating them. In one of his
journeys with his master, he chanced to fall among those queer grasshoppers&mdash;the lubber locusts. As he ran along
through the grass, his feet started up hundreds of the clumsy fellows, and, in trying to jump out of his way, they came
down in groups upon him, as you see in the picture. Some stood on their heads upon his back; others turned somersaults
over his ears, and a few struck him full in the face. Besides being impertinent they were very large, each two or three
times the size and weight of one of our modest little hoppers. So poor Tom was first annoyed, and then scared. One or
two, or even half a dozen, he could eat up or drive away, but a hundred were too many, and at last Tom dropped his head
and tail and ran for his life, while his master scolded, and his master's friend laughed at the droll sight of a big dog
running away from grasshoppers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear St. Nicholas:</span> While reading in the November number of <span class="smcap">St.
Nicholas</span> about "Our Joe," I thought some of the <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> readers would be
interested in hearing about <em>our</em> Joe. <em>Our</em> Joe is a Broncho pony that belonged to Rain-in-the-face, a
chief in one of Sitting Bull's bands. When the ponies were taken and driven down in a drove, Our Joe got loose from the
others and was caught somewhere near here. His name was Joe, but when Papa brought him home and we saw how little he
was, we called him Little Joe, and when we rode him he went so easy we named him Little Joe Dandy.</p>

<p>We have a little red cart we call the dump, to drive him in. He is such a funny little fellow that everybody has to
take a second look at him. I am five feet tall, and his shoulders are not quite as high as mine; his hair in winter is
as thick and long as a buffalo's; his tail touches the ground, and his mane hangs far down on his shoulders, and is
always stuck full of burrs in summer. His color is iron-gray, if it's anything, but it's hard to tell what color he is.
I had my picture taken on horseback, and he looks as if he was about ready to fall asleep, but he has life in him if he
takes a notion to go! He is mean to the boys. He picked my brother up by the shoulder and shook him, and one day he
kicked Papa.</p>

<p>There was a pair of them&mdash;Our Joe and a Little Buckskin. The Buckskin would bunt his head against Joe, as a
signal to go, and then they would make things fly! Every one who knew the pony before we got him says he was so ugly, it
was dangerous to go around him; but he is the kindest little fellow to us. If I go out in the pasture where he is, he
will follow me everywhere I go. We think the world of him. Hoping my letter is not too long, I remain,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear St. Nicholas:</span> In looking over our old <span class="smcap">St. Nicholases</span> we
found, in the January number for 1882, a piece entitled, "Puppets and Puppet Shows," and as it struck our fancy, we
agreed to try it. After several attempts, we succeeded in obtaining very good figures. With a little ingenuity and the
plans of three busy brains, we arranged an excellent screen and scenery; then, with two of us to work and one to read,
the puppets were set in motion. Our audience, though not large, was an appreciative one, and the show was a grand
success. The puppets were carefully placed in a box, and will be kept for another entertainment.</p>

<p>Last summer we girls made a twine house in our orchard. A couple of cows strayed in one afternoon and ran through the
house, and the chickens dug up a number of the morning-glories; but, in spite of these obstacles, a great many happy
hours were spent in the house.</p>

<p>There is some splendid coasting and skating in Sweden, but I do not think the young people here would enjoy going to
boarding-school there; at least, not the one I went to. They are very strict. For instance, once when I did not know my
lesson, I had to stay up until 12 o'clock that night and study it by moonlight, without having had a bit of supper; and
the next morning, instead of my breakfast, I had to stand in the center of the dining-room and watch the others eat. I

fought. It overlooks the quiet little town,

wooden horses, which I will describe to you, as it may interest some of your little readers. You take a keg and bore
four holes in the side of it, and then take short round handles and put four of them into the holes. Then take two
shingles and drive them into one end of the keg (for a neck); then take another shingle and cut to the shape of a
horse's head, and put it between the two shingles that have been driven on to the top of the keg; then put a feather
duster in the other end, and you have a horse complete; when done, they are comical-looking enough. I like to read the
letters in the Letter-box. I hope you will print my letter, as I have not written one before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Greenville, S. C.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear St. Nicholas</span> I have been a subscriber to your charming magazine for over three
years, and have never yet read a letter dated Greenville, S. C., so thought I would write to you from that place.
Greenville is a city in the upper part of South Carolina. It is divided into two parts by a small river which runs
through it, and on which are several cotton-mills. It is about thirty miles from C&aelig;sar's Head, a mountain said to
bear a striking resemblance to a profile view of the human face. It used to be a stopping-point for travelers on their
way to Greenville. During the very severe weather last winter, we thought that our town, instead of being called
Greenville, should be named after some snowy berg of Greenland.</p>

<p>It seems to be the custom of your correspondents to give their ages and a minute description of their occupation, so
I will follow. I am fourteen years old, and have never been to school a day in my life, my mother having always taught
me at home until this year, when I have a tutor for Algebra and Latin. I continue the study of French with my mother,
using Fasquelle's Grammar and reading a pretty story called "Le Petit Robinson de Paris," besides having lessons in
English composition, geography, history, declamation, music, and drawing.</p>

<p>I am a lineal descendant, being a great-great-granddaughter, of "The Martyr of the Revolution," as he is sometimes
called, Colonel Isaac Hayne, who was hanged by the British, and of whose execution at Charlestown a very interesting
account is given by Ramsay, in his "History of South Carolina." My grandmother had a lock of Colonel Hayne's hair. It
was a beautiful chestnut color, and had a slight wave through it. I am also a cousin of the poet, Paul Hayne.</p>

<p>I like all the stories in <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span>, but my favorite is "Little Lord Fauntleroy," who
seems to be a second Paul Dombey, with his quaint, old-fashioned sayings. I hope he will not die shut up in the gloomy
castle, with his cross old grandfather, away from the companionship of "Dearest."</p>

<p>With best wishes for the welfare of your delightful magazine, I remain,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Editor St. Nicholas:</span> I thought that perhaps the following-description of a sort of
kaleidoscope would be of service to your magazine, for the entertainment of your young readers, on a rainy evening:</p>

piano just as if for a player, but, instead of resting it on the surface of the piano itself, let it rest upon two or
three large books placed on the top of the piano, so as to form at the front, where the hinges are, an angle of sixty
degrees. Cover the open side of the triangle thus formed with a thick cover, which should extend also over the crack
caused by the hinges of the lid. Thus you will have a hollow, triangular prism, the length of the piano, open at both
ends. Polish well with a silk duster the inside of one end of this triangular prism; hold pieces of crazy patchwork, or
long pieces of silk ribbon,&mdash;the more variegated and brilliant the colors the better,&mdash;in a large hanging
bunch, and shake gently about two inches in front of the polished end toward the angle of the front, while the spectator
looks through the opposite end of the kaleidoscope. A watch, chain, or looking-glass among the ribbons makes a pleasing
variety.</p>

your pages all my life. I am too small to write you a letter all myself, so Mamma will write it, for I wish to tell you
about our salt crystals. You remember you told us how to make them, in your number for July, 1884. Mamma and I each
started one, and every one thinks they are great curiosities. Papa photographed them so that you could see them also.
The large one belongs to Mamma, and the small one is mine; they are about five months old. We have ceased adding salt
and water, and have them under a glass shade, one resting on the other, and they make a very pretty ornament. Every time
we stop to admire them we smack our lips and think how well-seasoned the <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> always

<p class="smcap">A Course of Observations on Trees.</p>

<p>The United States Government, through the Forestry Division of the Agricultural Department, solicits the assistance
of volunteer observers belonging to the Agassiz Association. The chief of the Division of Forestry, in consultation with
the President of the A. A., is preparing a special "schedule of phenological observations" for the A. A. This is a very
simple series of questions, in spite of its long name. One object of this series of observations is to determine the
effect of climate upon the growth of plants. Among the facts to be noted are the dates of the appearance of first leaf,
first flower, and first fruit. Nothing is required that can not be accurately and easily done by an intelligent boy or
girl of twelve years of age. It is earnestly desired by the Department that as many as possible of our members undertake
this work, in the interest of science, and for the practical results of the information sought.</p>

<p>All who are willing to try, will kindly send their addresses, at once, to "The Chief of the Division of Forestry,
Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C."</p>

<p>The complete schedule of observations desired will then be sent to them, and they can begin at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Paul L. Smith</span>, President of Chapter 653, of La Porte, Ind., goes fifty-nine miles, on
the first Saturday of every month, to preside at the meetings of his Chapter. And yet some doubt whether Natural History

<p class="smcap">The A. A. by the Sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Florence May Lyon</span> and two associate teachers of the Detroit High School, members of
Chapter 743, are making arrangements to take a bevy of a dozen or twenty young ladies for a summer vacation of six
weeks, to the charming town of Annisquam, Mass. They propose to teach them in as "unbookish and delightful a way as
possible about sea-side plants and animals." These ladies have had abundant experience, and we wish them the greatest
success.</p>


<hr style="width:10%" />

<p class="smcap">Birds' Eggs.</p>

<p>The destruction of the singing birds of America is a growing and a very serious evil. Many ladies wear on their
bonnets enough birds to flood a grove with melody&mdash;if only the birds were not dead and in pieces.</p>

<p>We may make an appeal on this subject to the girls and women of the A. A., at a later date, but just now it is a
question of robbing birds' nests. This association strictly maintains the scientific ground that when birds' eggs are
actually <em>needed</em> by a young naturalist, as a means of identification or of practical knowledge, it is
justifiable to take them, when the law allows. But the collection of eggs as curiosities, and the wholesale robbery of
nests for purposes of sale or exchange, is a wanton destruction wholly unworthy of any earnest student of nature.</p>

<p>In view of the impossibility of discriminating between the two classes of collectors, we shall hereafter decline to
publish in <span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span>, any requests for the sale, purchase, or exchange of the eggs of
singing or game birds.</p>

<p class="smcap">Delayed Chapter Reports.</p>

<p>60, <em>Pigeon Cove, Mass.</em> We have not lost a member from our books since you first enrolled us, and although at
present we are all so occupied by our daily work that we can not hold regular meetings, we all look forward to the time
when we shall be able to begin again.&mdash;Charles H. Andrews.</p>

<p>150, <em>Flushing, L. I.</em> Our Chapter has not been very active during the past year, but I hope in the near
future to build up a lively Chapter. Father and Mother will help me.&mdash;Frances M. L. Heaton, Sec.</p>

<p>189, <em>W. Medford, Mass.</em> The Chapter is still in existence, and is holding meetings every week.&mdash;Daisy G.
Dame, Sec.</p>

<p>257, <em>Plantsville, Conn.</em> We have been very successful; meetings full of interest and well attended. Our last
paper on "Crystals" was by E. N. Walkley, who illustrated the subject by plaster casts. We have a good male quartet in
our Chapter; also gentlemen who play on the violin, flute, piano, and 'cello, so we can have a good time if we want it,
at any meeting.</p>

<p>We have just papered, painted, and whitewashed our room, and intend to give an entertainment to procure funds to buy
a new carpet (<em>Bravo!</em>)&mdash;Albert L. Ely, Pres.</p>

<p>287, <em>Ottawa, Ill.</em> Our members are scattered, some in college, most of the others going soon; but we do not
wish to be counted out of that society from which we have received so much pleasure and profit.&mdash;Edgar Eldredge,
Sec.</p>

<p>331, <em>New Orleans, La.</em> This Chapter has passed through severe trials, being sustained at one time by only two
earnest members, but it is now triumphantly successful. It is unique in that it has for its president a gentleman, Mr.
P. M. Hoit, who lives in Santa Barbara, California, more than fifteen hundred miles away from the Chapter. He sends
plans of work, rules of order, by-laws, etc., and really governs the Chapter, with which he first became acquainted
through a letter asking about exchanges. The Chapter has over 600 specimens.&mdash;Percy S. Benedict, Sec.</p>

<p>350, <em>Los Angeles, Cal.</em> The children never tire of going to the beach, and a trip to the mountains is another
favorite excursion. Our cabinets grow, and I sometimes fear we shall get crowded out of the house by the "trash" that is
accumulating!&mdash;Mrs. M. F. Bradshaw, Sec.</p>

<p>366, <em>Webster Groves, Mo.</em> We have thirteen workers, all active.
<br />
We have a collection of 510 specimens, mostly minerals and fossils of our own State; a library of 123 volumes; a
microscope; and a chemical laboratory. We intend to hold an encampment this summer. How do you think it would work to
have a "Midsummer Night's Dream," on some summer evening?&mdash;we might have the telescope-man come out from the city,
do some star-gazing, and have an open-air magic lantern entertainment? (<em>It would work "to a
charm"!</em>)&mdash;Edwin R. Allan, Sec.</p>

<p>400, <em>Fargo, Dakota.</em> We gave an oyster supper a few weeks ago, and cleared $15. Our rooms are in the Masonic
Block, and the Masons kindly let us use their dishes for the occasion. We have one of the finest rooms for this class of
work in the Northwest. Our members are taking hold in earnest, and it will be a success. We have a fine teacher in Judge
Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell will be glad to aid any of the western Chapters, if they wish. I think for my part there could be
more chapters formed in Dakota, if the boys

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">[Pg 718]</a></span>

and girls would volunteer work earnestly. How many of the Dakota Chapters would like to organize the Dakota Assembly of
the A. A.? Those in favor will please correspond with me.&mdash;Frank Brown, Sec.</p>

<p>403, <em>Newark, N. J.</em> We have begun to study the mounting of plants and leaves. We are going to admit some lady
friends to our Chapter, which we think will be a great benefit to us.&mdash;Chas. Barrows, Sec. Wm. Earle, Pres.</p>

<p>404, <em>Baraboo, Wis.</em> We are still working, and our collection is steadily growing. One of our boys caught a
common painted turtle, I put it into a tub with another of the same kind. They soon became so tame that they took food
from my hand quite readily. One day I fed them as usual, but before they finished their meal I emptied the water from
the tub, when one of them that had a worm in its mouth began to choke and could not swallow. I gave the other one, too,
but he only took the end of it in his mouth. But as soon as I put water enough in for them to cover their heads, they
swallowed as easily as ever. I tried this several times with the same result. We gave an entertainment and cleared
$25.&mdash;Marie McKennan, Sec.</p>

<p>409, <em>Sag Harbor, N. Y.</em> This year has been marked by greater progress than any other since our organization.
In April, 1885, a valuable addition was made to our cabinet by the finding of a shrew&mdash;<em>genus sorex</em>. This
little animal, the least of the mammals, measured not quite two inches in length, excluding the tail. During May and
June we organized for summer work, on a new plan,&mdash;the President appointing committees to collect in special
departments. In July and August we spent numerous "field-days" in the woods and on the shore. We found a rare specimen
of trap-rock. The skeleton of a bottle-fish excited a great deal of curiosity. One of our members who had caught a live
one identified it.</p>

<p>In November, we commenced a series of discussions: "Which is of more value to mankind&mdash;cotton or wool?" (Decided
in favor of wool.) "What is the most useful mammal?" (Four members voted for cow and four for sheep.) "What insect is
most valuable in promoting human happiness?" (Decided for honey-bee.) "What is the most valuable fish?" (Cod.) Many
other questions were debated. We have received many curious specimens: sea-horse, porcupine-fish, key-hole shells, etc.
We intend to collect sea-weed and mosses this summer.&mdash;Cornelius R. Sleight, Sec.</p>

<p>423, <em>Perth Amboy, N. J.</em> Our thirty members have manifested great interest in collecting and examining
specimens from the different divisions of the animal kingdom. Much attention has been given to articulates, including
insects of the sea. At present we are engaged in a very interesting course of observation in mineralogy. We have the
highest appreciation of the assistance we have derived from the A. A., in learning to observe and love
nature.&mdash;Bertha M. Mitchell, Cor. Sec.</p>

<p>424, <em>Decorah, Iowa.</em> Several of our lady members are teachers, and highly value our meetings. We shall try to
have public lectures in geology. We are connecting with these subjects that of humane work, proposing to organize as the
Agassiz Band of Mercy. So we have two harmonious lines of good work begun, and hope to make both of them
permanent.&mdash;M. R. Steele, Sec.</p>

<p>428, <em>St. Paul, Minn.</em> Since our organization we have had seventy-eight meetings, all at our house. As one of
our number is studying for the occupation of mining engineer, and has a forge, furnace, lathe, etc., we have decided to
study iron, steel, and the methods of mining and manufacturing them. We have a club-room, where we keep our cabinets,
and a small library.&mdash;Philip C. Allen, Sec.</p>

<p>436, <em>Toronto, Canada.</em> Our president and several of our members have moved from town, so we have done
comparatively nothing since I wrote you. But Charles Ashdown and I are endeavoring to get some new members, and I
believe we shall have a stronger and better Chapter than ever.&mdash;David J. Howell, Sec.</p>

<p>439, <em>Wilmington, Del.</em> We have collected more cocoons and chrysalids this winter than ever before. Many of
them are very rare, among them, <em>Achemon</em>, <em>P. satellitia</em>, <em>Smerinthis gemmatus</em>, <em>E.
imperalis</em>, and <em>Callosama angulitera</em>.&mdash;Percy C. Pyle.</p>

<p>440, <em>Keene, N. H.</em> We have several hundred specimens, mostly <em>lepidoptera</em> and <em>coleoptera</em>.
Have found a great many fine beetles lately under the bark of dead trees and stumps where they pass the winter. We
always note the place of capture of all specimens, and all other items of interest.&mdash;Frank H. Foster, Sec.</p>

<p>448, <em>Washington, D. C.</em> We bring to our third anniversary, a gratifying sense of well-being and desert, with
promise of continued vigor. Our portfolios hold 343 reports, and every member is there represented. Our fifty books and
pamphlets are read with application. We are ambitious for a children's Chapter, and long to make discoveries. Perhaps
some of us may some day, and with this thrilling thought we are planning careful summer walks, with thoughtful
"observation books."&mdash;Sabelle Macfarland.</p>

<p>450, <em>Fitchburg, Mass.</em> As we have consolidated all our Fitchburg Chapters into one, now known as No. 48,
Fitchburg, A, there is no special report from 450, but I think we now have an earnest society on a solid
foundation.&mdash;Geo. F. Whittemore.</p>

<p>453, <em>Oswego, N. Y.</em> Active. Will soon hold meetings weekly instead of fortnightly. Special study for the year
has been archaeology and geology. Have been much interested in the <em>archeopteryx</em>. On archaeology, will send you
a more lengthy report.&mdash;Will A. Burr, Sec.</p>

<p>[<em>The promised report came in due time, and it is a masterpiece of patient work,&mdash;carefully illustrated with
drawings of Indian arrow-heads, axes, pottery, needles, fish-hooks, pipes, and anvils. It covers twelve pages closely
written. We value it, and have placed it carefully on file.</em>]</p>

<p>460, <em>Washington, D. C.</em> This Chapter was organized in the spring of 1882 from a small association we then
had; it had already existed for two years or more when we heard of the A. A. We concluded this would give us a wider
scope for scientific investigations, and so made formal application for admission into the Association, which had
already advanced with marvelous rapidity.</p>

<p>Vernon M. Dorsey, an unusually promising mineralogist and chemist, was elected president. When a new member was
elected it cost him nothing, so he was elected with the full consent of <em>all</em> the members, not one objecting.
Passive members were allowed in this Chapter, they paying ten cents a month, which money went into the treasury.</p>

<p>We adopted most of the rules and regulations in the Hand-book, and, after having arranged the executive portion of
the Chapter, we commenced to have a regular course of essays or lectures, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, given by the active
members, which lectures the passive members could attend if so inclined. After the lectures we generally had debates,
and as each member had a different branch of Natural History to which he devoted his attention, the lectures and debates
were not monotonous.</p>

<p>We ran on pretty smoothly for about a year and a half, until the money in the treasury commenced to accumulate, when,
with the exception of one or two members, the Chapter spontaneously combusted.</p>

<p>We have never been able to rebuild it. We can hold no meetings. <em>It exists</em>, really, <em>only in name</em>,
because the prospects for the future look rather dull.</p>

<p>If you will allow our Chapter to remain on the list, I should much prefer you would do so.</p>

<p>I have carried on investigations in various branches of zo&ouml;logy, but, as this is merely a report of the Chapter, I
will not enter into details concerning them.</p>

<p>I hope that the other Chapters will meet with better success than ours, though it may yet revive.</p>

<p>[<em>We are sorry that this excellent Chapter experienced "spontaneous combustion," but we hope and believe that it
will ere long also experience voluntary resurrection.</em>]</p>

<p>465, <em>Waterville, Maine.</em> Our president has moved away. The rest of us have been exceedingly busy. We have been
obliged to vacate our room, and, as we could not get another, have had to store our specimens. But we are not dead yet!
Far from it! It is only a case of suspended animation. We fully expect to take up work again this summer.&mdash;Charles
W. Spencer, Sec.</p>

<p>[<em>Not even "suspended animation;" the Chapter is only catching its breath for more vigorous exertion.</em>]</p>

<p>470, <em>Nicollet, Wis.</em> Still prospering. We have a small room nicely fitted up, in our High School building, of
which we are quite proud. We have a working membership of twenty-four, and hold regular meetings.</p>

<p>[<em>A friend of the Chapter adds to this report of Miss Sara Ritchie, the secretary, the following:</em>]</p>

<p>"I was exceedingly interested in listening to the different members reporting formally the occurrence of our spring
birds, with which was associated the arrival of certain insects. Two years ago, such reports were impossible, as the
observing faculties of very few of the members had been sufficiently trained. If nothing more has been acquired, this
one habit of close observation, developed by our A. A. work, is worth all it may have cost those who have encouraged and
carried out the plan of the Association."</p>

<h3>METAMORPHOSES.</h3>

<p>The problem is to change one given word to another given word, by altering one letter at a time, each alteration
making a new word, the number of letters being always the same, and the letters remaining always in the same order.
Sometimes the metamorphoses may be made in as many moves as there are letters in each given word, but in other instances
more moves are required.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example</span>: Change <span class="smcap">LAMP</span> to <span class="smcap">FIRE</span> in four
moves. Answer, <span class="smcap">LAMP</span>, <span class="smcap">LAME</span>, <span class="smcap">FAME</span>, <span
class="smcap">FARE</span>, <span class="smcap">FIRE</span>.</p>

<p>1. Change <span class="smcap">COW</span> to <span class="smcap">RAT</span> in three moves. 2. Change <span
class="smcap">HARD</span> to <span class="smcap">SOFT</span> in six moves. 3. Change <span class="smcap">LEFT</span> to
<span class="smcap">EAST</span> in four moves. 4. Change <span class="smcap">HIT</span> to <span
class="smcap">LOW</span> in four moves. 5. Change <span class="smcap">LONG</span> to <span class="smcap">WEST</span> in
five moves.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
